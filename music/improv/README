This is where I put all the stuff I play on the piano.  Whether it's
practicing or improvising, I'll log it here.  This should populate more
quickly when I get my digital piano (any day now).  So far, everything
has been played on a four-octave Roland MIDI controller with a broken
high C and middle F#... very awkward.

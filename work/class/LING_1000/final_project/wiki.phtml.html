<p><strong>African-American Vernacular English</strong> (<strong>AAVE</strong>), also called <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebonics" title="Ebonics">Ebonics</a></strong>, <strong>Black English</strong>, or <strong>Black English Vernacular</strong>
(<strong>BEV</strong>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect" title="Dialect">dialect</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English" title="American English">American English</a>. Similar to common southern U.S. English, the dialect is spoken by many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American" title="African-American">African-Americans</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>.

and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language" title="Creole language">creole</a> English dialects spoken by blacks worldwide. AAVE also has
grammatical origins in, and pronunciational characteristics in common with, various West African languages.</p>
<p>The term <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebonics" title="Ebonics">Ebonics</a></em>, which is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> word of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebony" title="Ebony">ebony</a></em> and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonics" title="Phonics">phonics</a></em>, has been suggested as an alternative name for this dialect. However, that name is not widely
used in linguistic literature, although it enjoys considerable common use as a result of the controversy surrounding it (see

<h2>History and Social Context</h2>
<p>AAVE has its roots in the trans-Atlantic African slave trade.
Distinctive patterns of language usage among African slaves and,
later, African Americans arose out of the need for multicultural
populations of African captives to communicate among themselves,
and with their captors, in a hostile and alien environment. Crammed
together in holding pens on the West African coast and
chained together during the Middle Passage, these captives, many of
them already multi-lingual speakers of Wolof, Twi, Hausa,
Yoruba, Dogon, Akan, Kimbundu, Bambara and other languages, developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin" title="Pidgin">pidgins</a> --
simplified mixtures of two or more languages. Over time in the Americas, some of these pidgins became fully developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole" title="Creole">creole</a> languages. Significant numbers of African Americans still speak some of these creole
languages, notably Gullah on the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>As a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language" title="Language">language</a> is used by isolated and diverging groups of people, the language
itself becomes isolated and divergent. Pronunciational aspects of AAVE are in part based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_American_English" title="Southern American English">Southern American English</a> variety, an influence that no
doubt has been reciprocal as the dialects diverged. The traits of AAVE which separate it from standard English include
grammatical structures that are traceable to West African languages; changes in pronunciation along definable patterns, many of
which are found in Creole and pidgin dialects of other populations of West African descent; distinctive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang" title="Slang">slang</a>; and differences in the use of tenses. AAVE also has a substantial vocabulary little understood beyond
the African-American community, and has contributed several words with African origins now in common use in SAE: "gumbo,"
"goober," "yam," "banjo," "bogus" -- and even some slang expressions, such as "hip" and "hep cat."</p>
<p>It is common for an oppressed people (as, for example, African slaves in the Americas) to develop a radically different
dialect from that of their oppressors. Such a departure from majority language usage is, of course, a natural consequence of
cultural differences. However, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology" title="Sociology">sociologists</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics" title="Linguistics">linguists</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychologists</a> believe that such divergent
language development is often a kind of passive resistance to subjugation, oppression or cultural aggression. Language becomes a
means of self-differentiation that helps forge group identity, solidarity and ethnic pride. In the case of African-Americans,
AAVE has survived and thrived through the centuries also as a result of group societal marginalization -- through segregation,
discrimination and often self-imposed social separation.</p>
<p>Most speakers of AAVE are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Bidialectical&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="Bidialectical">bidialectical</a> in that they command <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_English" title="Standard English">Standard
American English</a> (SAE) to varying degrees in addition to AAVE. African Americans who speak AAVE exclusively are most commonly
southern and rural, or those with working-class roots. Many African-Americans however, regardless of their socioeconomic status,
educational background, or where they may live, use AAVE in informal and intra-ethnic communication. This process of selective
language usage, based on social context, is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching" title="Code-switching">code-switching</a>. Some
phrases in AAVE have entered popular American culture, and these may be contextually employed by speakers belonging to diverse
ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy" title="White supremacy">White supremacist</a>
beliefs and prevailing cultural
biases, Whites commonly believed the aberrant English of African slaves
was due to inferior intellect. Such prejudices persist
today. AAVE often is perceived by members of broader American society
as an indicator of inferior intelligence or low educational
attainment. Further, like many other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole" title="Creole">creole</a> dialects, AAVE sometimes has been called
"lazy" or "bad" English. Such appraisals may be due to AAVE's substitution of aspect for tense in some cases and certain
grammatical and phonological reductions. Some challenge whether AAVE should be considered a dialect at all.</p>
<p>However, such opinions have no basis in fact, and among linguists there is no such controversy.</p>
<p>In the late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s" title="1990s">1990s</a>,
the formal recognition of AAVE as a distinct dialect and its
proposed use as an educational tool to help African American students
become more fluent in SAE became a controversial subject in
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">U.S.</a>. See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebonics" title="Ebonics">Ebonics</a>.</p>
<p><a name="History_of_AAVE_as_a_Creole" id="History_of_AAVE_as_a_Creole"></a></p>
<h3>History of AAVE as a Creole</h3>
<p>When settlers arrived in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> to abduct slaves, they found that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_languages" title="African languages">African languages</a> exhibited very little mixing. Dillard (1972) attributes
to slave ship Captain William Smith:</p>
<dl>
<dd>As for the languages of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambia" title="Gambia">Gambia</a>, they are so many and so different, that the
Natives, on either Side of the River, cannot understand each other. ... [T]he safest Way is to trade with the different Nations,
on either Side of the River, and having some of every Sort on board, there will be no more Likelihood of their succeeding in a
Plot, than of finishing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel" title="Tower of Babel">Tower of Babel</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, some slaveowners often acquired a preference for slaves from a particular tribe, so language mixing aboard ship was
sometimes minimal. There is evidence that enslaved Africans, in fact, retained a great deal of their native languages until
almost 1700. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolof" title="Wolof">Wolof</a> became the basis of a sort of intermediary pidgin among Africans, and
it is this language that comes to the fore in tracing the African roots of AAVE.</p>
<p>As the African pidgin that would become AAVE was beginning to spread, two more dialects were developing and diffusing:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Pidgin_Portuguese&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="Pidgin Portuguese">Pidgin Portuguese</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Pidgin_French&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="Pidgin French">Pidgin French</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese" title="Portuguese">Portuguese</a> variety in particular was becoming very popular in Europe and The New World.
African-American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole" title="Creole">creoles</a> that have undergone the least interference over the last few
centuries (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Saramaccan&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="Saramaccan">Saramaccan</a>) show
evidence of Portuguese features and vocabulary.</p>
<p>By 1715, the African pidgin was widely enough known to make its way into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Defoe" title="Daniel Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>'s novels, in particular, <em>The Life of Colonel Jacque</em>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Mather" title="Cotton Mather">Cotton Mather</a> claimed to have been very familar with his slaves' speech. He knew enough to affirm that
one of his slaves was from the <em>Coromantee</em> tribe. Mather's imitative writing showed features present in many creoles and
even in modern day AAVE.</p>
<p>By the time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a>, African-American
creoles had not quite established themselves to the point of mutual intelligibility among varieties. Dillard (1972) references a
recollection of "slave language" toward the latter part of the eighteenth century:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Kay, massa, you just leave me, me sit here, great fish jump up into da canoe, here he be, massa, fine fish, massa; me den
very grad; den me sit very still, until another great fish jump into de canoe; but me fall asleep, massa, and no wake 'til you
come; ....</dd>
</dl>
<p>It wasn't until the time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> that the language
of the slaves became familiar to a large number of educated whites. The abolitionist papers before the war form a rich corpus of
examples of plantation creole. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wentworth_Higginson" title="Thomas Wentworth Higginson">Thomas Wentworth
Higginson</a> published book titled <em>Army Life in a Black Regiment</em> (1870). In the book, he details many features of his
soldiers' language. In particular, this book contains the first reference to the distinction between stressed BÍN and unstressed
bin.</p>
<p>After the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism" title="Abolitionism">Emancipation</a>, some freed slaves traveled to West Africa,
taking their creole with them. In certain African tribal groups, such as those in East <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon" title="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>, there are varieties of Black English that show strong resemblances to the creole dialects in the U.S.
documented during this time period. The languages have remained relatively the same due to the homogeneity within tribal groups.
As a result, they can act as windows into a past state of creole English.</p>
<p><a name="The_Ethnic_Boundary_for_Speakers_of_AAVE" id="The_Ethnic_Boundary_for_Speakers_of_AAVE"></a></p>
<h3>The Ethnic Boundary for Speakers of AAVE</h3>
<p>In southern parts of the United States, particularly South Carolina and Georgia, the language varieties used between
Caucasians and African-Americans converge somewhat. However, there remain significant differences arising from several
factors.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_class" title="Socioeconomic class">Socioeconomic class</a> is a factor worth considering.
Certainly in urban areas, large numbers of blacks often are concentrated in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class" title="Working class">working class</a>. Perhaps linguistic similarities "clump" inside a particular class in order to form an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_identity" title="Cultural identity">identity</a>. They do, but significant differences persist even when
socioeconomic status, education, and geography are relatively well controlled (Rickford 1999).</p>
<p>A significant boundary element turns out to be the structure of the origin language of the speaker. White speakers usually
come from roots related to Standard English, whereas, historically, Black speakers come from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_languages" title="African languages">African origin languages</a>. Although vocabulary easily diffuses, more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax" title="Syntax">syntactic</a> structure is acquired at younger ages, so it doesn't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_%28anthropology%29" title="Diffusion (anthropology)">diffuse</a> across cultural boundaries as easily. Even phonological features diffuse more easily than
syntax, especially in adolescence, during the period where adolescents are identifying heavily with their peers.</p>
<p>We see that if a syntactic boundary is to be crossed that it must be done at young ages. Young children tend to spend a good
proportion of their time with their parents, so the impression that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics" title="Genetics">genetics</a> plays
a role can be incorrectly perceived. However, in the abscence or low frequency of interracial couples, this fact helps to
preserve the ethnic boundary between speakers.</p>
<p>The most important factor effecting the resistance of diffusion
accross ethnic boundaries is the identity each culture
conciously maintains. There are implicit standards about how a "good
White boy" ought to talk. Conversely, if a Black person
begins to take on too White a dialect, they are stigmatically
categorized as an "oreo". Because of the historical underdog status
of the Black culture, Black communities remain close, and "defects" are
more emphatically shunned.</p>
<p><a name="Educational_Issues" id="Educational_Issues"></a></p>
<h3>Educational Issues</h3>
<p>Teaching children whose first language is AAVE poses problems wider than simply what techniques to add to the pedagogy. This
topic foots a suite of contraversial political issues. Foremost, America is divided on whether to even recognize AAVE as a
legitamate dialect of English, as discussed in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebonics" title="Ebonics">Ebonics</a> article.</p>
<p>When teaching anyone a language or dialect with which they are unfamiliar, it is important to differentiate between
understanding and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation" title="Pronunciation">pronunciation</a>. For instance, if a child reads "He
passed by both of them" as "<em>he pass by bowf uh dem</em>", a teacher must determine whether the child is saying "passed" or
"pass," since they are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym" title="Homonym">homonyms</a> in AAVE <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology" title="Phonology">phonology</a>. Appropriate remedial strategies in such a case would be different from effective strategies in the
case of an SE speaker who read "passed" as "<em>pass</em>".</p>
<p>A strategy was introduced by Baratz and Stewart (1969) that introduced AAVE speakers to reading using "dialect
readers"&#8212;sets of reading nearer to the child's dialect than SE text. This helps the child focus on translating symbols on
paper into words without worrying about learning a new language at the same time. Simpkins, Holt, and Simpkins (1977) introduced
a comprehensive set of dialect readers, called <em>bridge readers</em>, which included the same content in three different
dialects: AAVE, a <em>bridge</em> version, which was closer to SE without being prohibitively formal, and a Standard English
version. The bridge program showed very promising results, but didn't become widely adopted for various political reasons mostly
related to the failure to recognize AAVE as a dialect of English.</p>

<h2>Grammatical features</h2>
<p>Note: The following pronunciations are written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMPA" title="SAMPA">SAMPA</a>. See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMPA_chart" title="SAMPA chart">SAMPA chart</a> for reference.</p>
<p><a name="Phonological_features" id="Phonological_features"></a></p>
<h3>Phonological features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduction of certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong" title="Diphthong">diphthong</a> forms to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophthong" title="Monophthong">monophthongs</a>, in particular, [aI] to [a] and [oI] to [o]. For example, "boy" pronounced as "boh".</li>
<li>Pronunciation of unvoiced [T] (as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_English" title="Standard English">SE</a> <strong>th</strong>ing)
as either [t] or [f]. The former usually occurs leading a word, and the latter otherwise.</li>
<li>Pronunciation of voiced [D] (as in SE <strong>th</strong>en) as [d] when leading a word or [v] otherwise. For example,
"bro<strong>th</strong>er" as "bru<strong>v</strong>a".</li>
<li>AAVE is non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic" title="Rhotic">rhotic</a>, so [r] is usually dropped if not followed by a vowel. However,
the [r] may also be dropped in other cases, e.g. "story" realized as "sto'y".</li>
<li>Realization of final <em>ng</em> as <em>n</em>, e.g. "tripping" as "trippin".</li>
<li>More generally, reduction of vocally homogeneous final consonant clusters. That is, <em>test</em> becomes <em>tes</em> (they
are both voiceless), <em>hand</em> becomes <em>han</em> (they are both voiced), but <em>pant</em> is unchanged, as it contains
both a voiced and an unvoiced consonant in the cluster (Rickford, 1997).</li>
<li>In certain cases, transposition of adjacent consonants, particularly when the first is [s]. For instance "ask" realized as
"aks" or "gasp" as "gaps".</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Aspect_marking" id="Aspect_marking"></a></p>
<h3>Aspect marking</h3>
<p>The most distinguishing feature of AAVE is the use of forms of <em>be</em> to mark <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect" title="Grammatical aspect">aspect</a> in verb phrases. The use or lack of a form of <em>be</em> can indicate whether or not the
performance of the verb is of a habitual nature. In SAE, this can be expressed only using adverbs such as <em>usually</em>. It is
disputed whether the use of the verb "to be" to indicate a habitual status or action in AAVE has its roots in various West
African languages.</p>

<p><a name="Remote_Phase_Marker" id="Remote_Phase_Marker"></a></p>
<h4>Remote Phase Marker</h4>
<p>The aspect marked by stressed BÍN has been given many names, including <em>Perfect Phase</em>, <em>Remote Past</em>,
<em>Remote Phase</em> (Fickett 1970, Fasold and Wolfram 1970, Rickford 1999, respectively). This article uses the latter of the
three.</p>
<p>With non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stative_verb" title="Stative verb">stative verbs</a>, the role of BÍN is simple: it places the action
in the distant past, or represents total completion of the action. A decent translation is adding "a long time ago" as an
adverbial phrase onto the sentence. For example, <em>She BÍN tell me that</em> translates as "She told me that a long time
ago."</p>
<p>However, when BÍN is used with stative verbs, or when it is used with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund" title="Gerund">gerund</a> forms,
BÍN represents that the action began in the distant past and that it is continuing now. Rickford (1999) suggests that a better
translation when used with stative verbs is "for a long time".</p>
<p>For instance, in response to "I like your new dress", you might hear <em>Oh, I BÍN had this dress", meaning that the speaker
has had the dress for a long time, and that it isn't new.</em></p>
<p>To illustrate the difference between the simple past and the gerund when used with BÍN, consider the utterances:</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>I BÍN bought her clothes</em> means "I bought her clothes a long time ago."</dd>
<dd><em>I BÍN buyin her clothes</em> means "I've been buying her clothes for a long time."</dd>

<h3>Negation</h3>
<p>In addition, negatives are formed differently from standard American English:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of <em>ain'</em> as a general negative indicator. It is used in place of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_English" title="Standard English">SE</a> "am not", "isn't", and "aren't".</li>
<li>Negation agreement, as in <em>I didn't go nowhere</em>, such that if the sentence is negative, all negatable forms are
negated. This can be traced to West African languages, but is usually stigmatized in Standard English (although this wasn't
always so; see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_negative" title="Double negative">double negative</a>).</li>
<li>If the subject is indefinite (e.g. <em>nobody</em> instead of <em>Sally</em> or <em>he</em>), it can be inverted with the
negative qualifier (turning <em>Nobody knows the answer</em> to <em>Don't nobody know the answer</em>, also adding multiple
negation). This emphasizes the negative, and is not interrogative, as it would be in SAE.</li>

<h3>Lexical features</h3>
<p>AAVE uses the lexicon of SE, particularly informal and southern dialects. There are some notable differences, however. In
particular, certain English words share the sound of words from West African languages, and we can see the connection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>bogus</strong> is derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa" title="Hausa">Hausa</a> <em>boko</em>, meaning deciet or
fraud.</li>
<li><strong>cat</strong> is the suffix -kat from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolof" title="Wolof">Wolof</a>, which denotes a person.</li>
<li><strong>dig</strong> comes from Wolof <em>deg</em> or <em>dega</em>, meaning "to understand/appreciate".</li>
<li><strong>hip</strong> is derived from Wolof <em>hepi</em>, meaning "to be aware of what's going on".</li>
<li><strong>honky</strong> may come from Wolof <em>honq</em>, meaning red or pink.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other grammatical characteristics</h3>
<p>Some of these characteristics, notably double negatives and the use of <em>been</em> for "has been", are also characteristic
of general colloquial American English.</p>
<p>Linguist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Labov" title="William Labov">William Labov</a> carried out and published the first thorough
grammatical study of African American Vernacular English in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1965" title="1965">1965</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Present tense verbs are uninflected for person: there is no -s ending in the present tense third person singular. Example:
<em>She write poetry</em> (="She writes poetry")</li>
<li>There is no -s ending indicating possession&#8212;the genitive relies on adjacency. This is similar to many creole dialects
throughout the Caribbean Sea. Example: <em>my baby mama</em> (="my baby's mama")</li>
<li>The word <em>it</em> denotes the existence of something, equivalent to Standard English <em>there</em> in "there is", or
"there are". Examples <em>It's a doughnut in the cabinet</em> (="There's a doughnut in the cabinet") and <em>It is no spoon</em>
(="There is no spoon").</li>
<li>Altered clause order in questions: <em>She tryin' to act white. She think who the hell she is?</em> (="She's trying to act
white. Who the hell does she think she is?")</li>
</ul>

Restate the Lipschitz condition to be: for every $x,y \in [a,b]$ with $x
\not= y$, $\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{x-y} < L$.  We can see that this implies
$f'(x) < L$ for every $x \in [a,b]$ by the definition of the derivative.
That is, the Lipschitz condition is stronger than the assumption made by
the theorem, so the theorem is still valid.

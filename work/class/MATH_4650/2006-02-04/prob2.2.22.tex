The statement of this theorem is almost tautological. If $g$ is
continuously differentiable on $(c,d)$, $p \in (c,d)$, $g(p) = p$ and
$|g'(p)| < 1$, then there is some neighborhood $(a,b)$ around $p$ where
the absolute derivative is also less than 1.  Since this is true, $f(a)
> a$ and $f(b) < b$, so $f((a,b)) \subseteq (a,b)$.  Then this
neighborhood satisfies the conditions of the fixed point theorem.

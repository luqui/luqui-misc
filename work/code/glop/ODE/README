ODE version 0.01
================

INSTALLATION

To install this module, first checkout ode somewhere:

    % cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/opende co ode

Build it:

    % cd ODE_INSTALL_DIR
    % cp config/user-settings.example config/user-settings
    ( look over user-settings and verify their sanity )
    % make ode-lib

Then come back and edit Makefile.PL, and set the $oderoot at the
top of the file to the path where you checked out ode (the
ODE_INSTALL_DIR above). Then type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

BUGS

If you get the message

    no library found (probably harmless): libstdc++

When you run the Makefile.PL, run make like so:

    make EXTRALIBS=-lstdc++ LDLOADLIBS=-lstdc++

2`49`AC1234 ` 
2`49`AC1234 `Procedure:  03/27/96             DICT: CONNIE STEVENSON, PT, CHT
2`49`AC1234 ` 
2`49`AC1234 ` 
2`49`AC1234 `DIAGNOSIS:  Dupuytren's release, right dominant hand, 1/3/96.
2`49`AC1234 ` 
2`49`AC1234 `SUBJECTIVE:  The patient reports using the static PIP extension
2`49`AC1234 `splint six hours per day and at night.  He reports that he does not
2`49`AC1234 `use the Wynn-Parry splint for the small finger as he feels that the
2`49`AC1234 `static splint is more affective.  He uses the putty for grip
2`49`AC1234 `strengthening four to five sessions per day.  He feels that he still
2`49`AC1234 `has difficulty controlling a tennis racquet.  He is able to write.
2`49`AC1234 ` 
2`49`AC1234 `OBJECTIVE:  Please see evaluation sheet for complete details.  Of
2`49`AC1234 `particular interest, active range of motion of the small finger PIP
2`49`AC1234 `joint is 50 degrees from neutral and the PIP flexes 82 degrees.  The
2`49`AC1234 `DIP joint flexes 55 degrees actively and passively flexes 57
2`49`AC1234 `degrees.  Initial grip strength measurements at position two days
2`49`AC1234 `are 42 pounds on the right and 72 pounds on the left.  Lateral pinch
2`49`AC1234 `is 20 pounds on the right and 21 pounds on the left.
2`49`AC1234 ` 
2`49`AC1234 `Today, the patient was provided with an isotoner compression glove
2`49`AC1234 `to be used at night with the static splint.  Part of the static
2`49`AC1234 `splint was remolded to an inch or a close and affective fit.  He
2`49`AC1234 `will continue to use this at night.  He was instructed to decrease
2`49`AC1234 `its use during the day to one hour 4 x per day.
2`49`AC1234 ` 
2`49`AC1234 `The patient was also provided with PIP/DIP flexion straps for the
2`49`AC1234 `ring and small fingers.  He was instructed to wear these five to
2`49`AC1234 `minutes prior to using the putty.  He was also provided with more
2`49`AC1234 `resistive putty to be used in place of the lighter putty.
2`49`AC1234 ` 
2`49`AC1234 `ASSESSMENT:  The patient's range of motion of PIP extension and
2`49`AC1234 `flexion on the ring and small fingers is essentially unchanged.
2`49`AC1234 `Current problems include the following:  Mild to moderate edema of
2`49`AC1234 `the ring and small fingers, PIP flexion contractures of the ring and
2`49`AC1234 `small fingers, incomplete flexion active range of motion
2`49`AC1234 `particularly the DIP joints, and decreased grip strength of the
2`49`AC1234 `right hand compared to the left.
2`49`AC1234 ` 
2`49`AC1234 `Addition of the PIP/DIP flexion strap was added to the program to
2`49`AC1234 `assist in gaining passive DIP flexion, to increase the potential for
2`49`AC1234 `increased active DIP flexion and ultimately increase grip strength
2`49`AC1234 `to assist him in controlling his tennis racquet.  His lack of
2`49`AC1234 `flexion range of motion and strength appears more troublesome
2`49`AC1234 `functionally than his limitations of extension; therefore, treatment
2`49`AC1234 `will continue to be directed at increasing flexion range of motion,
2`49`AC1234 `improving grip strength and decreasing edema to facilitate the
2`49`AC1234 `above.
2`49`AC1234 ` 
2`49`AC1234 `PLAN:  The patient is scheduled to return to the clinic to see
2`49`AC1234 `Dr. Goldner next week.  We will plan to see the patient at that time
2`49`AC1234 `also.

2`50`AC1234 ` 
2`50`AC1234 `Procedure:  03/05/96             DICT: CONNIE STEVENSON, PT, CHT
2`50`AC1234 ` 
2`50`AC1234 ` 
2`50`AC1234 `DIAGNOSIS:  Dupuytren's release, right dominant hand, 1/3/96.
2`50`AC1234 ` 
2`50`AC1234 `SUBJECTIVE:  The patient reports continuing to use the dorsal based
2`50`AC1234 `extension splint six hours per day.  He sleeps in the positive
2`50`AC1234 `pressure mold and volar splint which he did not bring today.  He is
2`50`AC1234 `not using the putty, as he prefers the spring eggerciser.  The
2`50`AC1234 `patient reports that he has played some tennis, but feels that the
2`50`AC1234 `small finger does not assist in controlling the racquet as much as
2`50`AC1234 `he needs.
2`50`AC1234 ` 
2`50`AC1234 `OBJECTIVE:  Please see range of motion chart for complete active
2`50`AC1234 `range of motion measurements for the long, ring and small fingers.
2`50`AC1234 `Of particular interest, is the measurements of the small finger
2`50`AC1234 `which are as follows:  Actively:  MP joint extends to 0 and flexes
2`50`AC1234 `to 81 degrees, actively PIP of the small finger extends to 50
2`50`AC1234 `degrees and flexes to 82 degrees.  Actively, DIP joint of the small
2`50`AC1234 `finger extends to 22 degrees and flexes to 46 degrees.
2`50`AC1234 ` 
2`50`AC1234 `The patient's status was discussed with Dr. Goldner today and the
2`50`AC1234 `program was changed as follows:  The patient will use the dorsal
2`50`AC1234 `extension splint at night.  During the day, he will use the
2`50`AC1234 `Wyn-Parry splint (a fingerbased Dynamic PIP extension splint for the
2`50`AC1234 `small finger).  He will also increase his use of Ace wrapping into
2`50`AC1234 `the composite passive flexion to be followed by use of the putty.
2`50`AC1234 `He was encouraged to do this in addition to the spring eggerciser to
2`50`AC1234 `assist in more flexion range of motion.  He indicated that he
2`50`AC1234 `understood all instructions.  Written instructions were provided for
2`50`AC1234 `the new Dynamic splint.  Emphasis was placed on adjusting the
2`50`AC1234 `tension so that it is comfortable and allows the splint to be worn
2`50`AC1234 `for at least 45 to 60 minutes.
2`50`AC1234 ` 
2`50`AC1234 `ASSESSMENT:  The patient's range of motion is essentially unchanged
2`50`AC1234 `with the exception of small finger PIP extension which has decreased
2`50`AC1234 `by 8 degrees.  Hopefully, the change in the program to include
2`50`AC1234 `Dynamic splinting in the daytime will assist in regaining some of
2`50`AC1234 `the range of motion that has been lost.  Also, changes in the home
2`50`AC1234 `exercise program should result in further gains of small finger
2`50`AC1234 `flexion active range of motion and strength.
2`50`AC1234 ` 
2`50`AC1234 `Will continue to work with the patient adjusting the home exercise
2`50`AC1234 `and splinting program to address the goals of improving PIP
2`50`AC1234 `extension, active and passive range of motion, improving small
2`50`AC1234 `finger PIP and DIP flexion active range of motion and increasing
2`50`AC1234 `grip strength.  Will measure grip strength at next visit to set a
2`50`AC1234 `specific goal.
2`50`AC1234 ` 
2`50`AC1234 `PLAN:  The patient is scheduled to return to hand therapy in two
2`50`AC1234 `weeks.

2`51`AC1234 `Procedure:  01/16/96             DICT: CONNIE STEVENSON, PT, CHT
2`51`AC1234 ` 
2`51`AC1234 ` 
2`51`AC1234 `DIAGNOSIS:  Excision palmar fibromatosis, right small and ring
2`51`AC1234 `finger and palm, 1/3/96, right dominant hand.
2`51`AC1234 ` 
2`51`AC1234 `SUBJECTIVE:  The patient reports that the splint has been
2`51`AC1234 `comfortable.  He reports that he has been performing exercises as
2`51`AC1234 `instructed.
2`51`AC1234 ` 
2`51`AC1234 `OBJECTIVE:  Today, the dressing was changed.  There is no particular
2`51`AC1234 `drainage today.  There is no erythema.  Edema is mild to moderate
2`51`AC1234 `throughout his hand.  Dressing was replaced.
2`51`AC1234 ` 
2`51`AC1234 `Splint was checked and found to be a good fit.  A minor modification
2`51`AC1234 `was made around the thumb.  The patient was encouraged to continue
2`51`AC1234 `to wear the splint between exercise sessions.
2`51`AC1234 ` 
2`51`AC1234 `The exercise program as described on 1/10/96 was carefully reviewed.
2`51`AC1234 `Emphasis was placed on small finger active MP flexion in both
2`51`AC1234 `isolated MP flexion exercise as well as composite active finger
2`51`AC1234 `flexion.  Emphasis was also placed on sustaining composite active
2`51`AC1234 `finger flexion exercise around the progressively smaller foam rolls.
2`51`AC1234 ` 
2`51`AC1234 `Please see range of motion chart for complete measurements.
2`51`AC1234 ` 
2`51`AC1234 `OBJECTIVE:  The patient has been able to use the splint and perform
2`51`AC1234 `the exercises, minor modifications were made to his exercise
2`51`AC1234 `technique.  Otherwise, he is tolerating the splint well and
2`51`AC1234 `progressing well.  PIP and DIP flexion improved on the small finger.
2`51`AC1234 `He did not have a decrease in PIP or DIP extension of any digit.
2`51`AC1234 ` 
2`51`AC1234 `PLAN:  The patient has been scheduled to return to hand therapy on
2`51`AC1234 `1/24/96.  He is to see Dr. Goldner on 1/20/96.  He was encouraged to
2`51`AC1234 `contact us if he has any problems or questions prior to return to
2`51`AC1234 `hand therapy.

2`52`AC1234 `Procedure:  01/10/96             DICT: CONNIE STEVENSON, PT, CHT
2`52`AC1234 ` 
2`52`AC1234 ` 
2`52`AC1234 `DIAGNOSIS:  Excision, palmar fibromatosis, right little finger and
2`52`AC1234 `palm, ring finger and palm, long finger palm only, 1/3/96, right
2`52`AC1234 `dominant hand.
2`52`AC1234 ` 
2`52`AC1234 `SUBJECTIVE:  The patient reports that his hand is relatively
2`52`AC1234 `comfortable.  The patient is a retired surgeon.  He reports that he
2`52`AC1234 `plays tennis, and returning to tennis is a primary concern for him.
2`52`AC1234 ` 
2`52`AC1234 `OBJECTIVE:  Today, sutures are in place.  There is an area of
2`52`AC1234 `drainage at the proximal finger flexion crease of ring finger.  The
2`52`AC1234 `wounds were dressed with xeroform, guaze, and stockenette.
2`52`AC1234 ` 
2`52`AC1234 `A dorsal protective splint was fabricated that positions the MP
2`52`AC1234 `joints at 0 degrees.  A strap brings the PIP and DIP joints into
2`52`AC1234 `extension, and is adjustable.  The splint allows the PIP joints to
2`52`AC1234 `extend slightly further than they can currently.  The patient was
2`52`AC1234 `instructed to wear this spint between exercise sessions.  He was
2`52`AC1234 `instructed to adjust the strap so that the splint is comfortable.
2`52`AC1234 `Written instructions were also provided.
2`52`AC1234 ` 
2`52`AC1234 `The patient was instructed in the following active exercises, to be
2`52`AC1234 `done every 1-2 hours:  Isolated MP flexion, blocked PIP and DIP
2`52`AC1234 `flexion, composite active finger flexion around progressively
2`52`AC1234 `smaller foam rolls.
2`52`AC1234 ` 
2`52`AC1234 `Active range of motion measurements were taken for the long, ring,
2`52`AC1234 `and small fingers, please see range of motion chart for these
2`52`AC1234 `measurements.
2`52`AC1234 ` 
2`52`AC1234 `OBJECTIVE:  Today, the patient presents with problems that include
2`52`AC1234 `mild to moderate edema, healing wound with one area that is open,
2`52`AC1234 `incomplete active range of motion.
2`52`AC1234 ` 
2`52`AC1234 `Long-term goal:  Is for the patient to return to independenc in all
2`52`AC1234 `activities, including playing tennis.
2`52`AC1234 ` 
2`52`AC1234 `Short-term goals for the next for weeks are as follows:  Decrease
2`52`AC1234 `edema, promote wound healing, increase active PIP extension, small
2`52`AC1234 `finger to 40 degrees, increase active MP flexion to 80 degrees on
2`52`AC1234 `all digits, increase active composite finger flexion such that the
2`52`AC1234 `fingertips come to within 1.0 cm of touching the DCP.
2`52`AC1234 ` 
2`52`AC1234 `PLAN:  The patient has been scheduled to return to hand therapy on
2`52`AC1234 `1/16/96 for dressing change, splint check and any necessary
2`52`AC1234 `adjustments, and review of the home exercise program.

2`53`AC1234 ` 
2`53`AC1234 ` 
2`53`AC1234 `DIAGNOSIS:  Excision, palmar fibromatosis, right little, ring and
2`53`AC1234 `long fingers, January 1996.
2`53`AC1234 ` 
2`53`AC1234 `SUBJECTIVE:  The patient uses the static extension splint at night
2`53`AC1234 `and uses the Wynn-Parry splint about four to five hours per day. He
2`53`AC1234 `feels that he has sustained some decrease in flexion range of motion
2`53`AC1234 `at the expense of gaining extension range of motion.  He also
2`53`AC1234 `indicates that he has lost his spring exercises which he feels is
2`53`AC1234 `beneficial.
2`53`AC1234 ` 
2`53`AC1234 `OBJECTIVE:  Today, active PIP extension of the small finger is 55
2`53`AC1234 `degrees.  Active PIP flexion is 90 degrees and active DIP flexion is
2`53`AC1234 `46 degrees.  Measurements are for the small finger.  Grip strength
2`53`AC1234 `at position 2 is 54 pounds on the right and 80 pounds on the left.
2`53`AC1234 `Grip strength at position 3 is 66 pounds on the right and 85 pounds
2`53`AC1234 `on the left.
2`53`AC1234 ` 
2`53`AC1234 `Today, the splints were adjusted slightly.  The patient will
2`53`AC1234 `continuing wearing them as above. He was instructed he could
2`53`AC1234 `gradually decrease the use of the day splint when he feels he has
2`53`AC1234 `plateaued.  He was provided with a 60 pound spring exerciser and
2`53`AC1234 `instructed in its proper use.  Emphasis was placed on relatively
2`53`AC1234 `short periods of exercise to minimize the problem with edema or
2`53`AC1234 `pain.
2`53`AC1234 ` 
2`53`AC1234 `ASSESSMENT:  Proximal interphalangeal joint extension active range
2`53`AC1234 `of motion is essentially what it was at the last visit (5/23/96);
2`53`AC1234 `however, when splinting has been stopped in the past, the patient
2`53`AC1234 `did sustain a decrease in the proximal interphalangeal joint
2`53`AC1234 `extension and therefore, some continued splinting is indicated.  The
2`53`AC1234 `patient's current grip strength at position 2 is 67% at the left and
2`53`AC1234 `at position 3, is 77% on the left. The appropriate equipment for
2`53`AC1234 `home strengthening exercise was provided.  The patient has the
2`53`AC1234 `appropriate program and does not need continued therapy at this
2`53`AC1234 `time.
2`53`AC1234 ` 
2`53`AC1234 `PLAN:  The patient is to return to see Dr. Goldner in September of
2`53`AC1234 `1996. We will see the patient if he is referred again.

2`54`AC1234 ` 
2`54`AC1234 `DIAGNOSIS:  Dupuytren's release, 1/3/96, right dominant hand.
2`54`AC1234 ` 
2`54`AC1234 `SUBJECTIVE:  The patient reports that since he saw Dr. Goldner last
2`54`AC1234 `week, he has been using the Wynn-Parry splint significantly more
2`54`AC1234 `during the day.  He feels that he has seen an improvement in PIP
2`54`AC1234 `extension.  He would like to delay or avoid casting if possible
2`54`AC1234 `through increased use of the Wynn-Parry splint.  He would like to be
2`54`AC1234 `able to do this so that he could continue to play tennis. (The cast
2`54`AC1234 `will not be removable and will not allow flexion of the PIP joint
2`54`AC1234 `beyond its contracted position.)

2`54`AC1234 `OBJECTIVE:  Today, measured dorsally active range of motion of the
2`54`AC1234 `small finger PIP extension is 60 degrees from neutral.  Passively,
2`54`AC1234 `the PIP joint extends to 55 degrees from neutral.  The Wynn-Parry (A
2`54`AC1234 `fingerbased dynamic PIP extension splint was checked.  An adjustment
2`54`AC1234 `was made on this splint to improve skin tolerance to the splint.)
2`54`AC1234 `He was instructed that he should not wear the splint for more than
2`54`AC1234 `one hour at a time, but that he should do so as often as possible
2`54`AC1234 `during the day with breaks in between.
2`54`AC1234 ` 
2`54`AC1234 `ASSESSMENT:  Compared to Dr. Goldner's measurement of last week
2`54`AC1234 `(which I believe was PIP extension of 70 or 75 degrees from neutral
2`54`AC1234 `actively, the patient would appear to have improved).  He appears
2`54`AC1234 `motivated to use the dynamic splint more so that he may remove it
2`54`AC1234 `for his flexion activities including tennis.  Dr. Goldner's stated
2`54`AC1234 `goal of last week was to improve the PIP extension to the position
2`54`AC1234 `at least of the patient's last visit with Dr. Goldner, which was PIP
2`54`AC1234 `extension of 50 degrees.  After extensive discussion with the
2`54`AC1234 `patient, it seemed reasonable to wait until next week to see if he
2`54`AC1234 `is able to make further gains.
2`54`AC1234 ` 
2`54`AC1234 `PLAN:  The patient is scheduled to return to hand therapy in one
2`54`AC1234 `week.

2`55`AC1234 `ANESTHESIA:  General.
2`55`AC1234 ` 
2`55`AC1234 `DRAINS:  A #16 French Foley catheter to straight drain.
2`55`AC1234 ` 
2`55`AC1234 `SPECIMENS:  Stone sent for analysis.
2`55`AC1234 ` 
2`55`AC1234 `CULTURES:  None.
2`55`AC1234 ` 
2`55`AC1234 `COMPLICATIONS:  None.
2`55`AC1234 ` 
2`55`AC1234 `BLOOD LOSS:  Minimal.
2`55`AC1234 ` 
2`55`AC1234 `INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  The patient recently came to the clinic
2`55`AC1234 `complaining of a four-day history of intermittent left flank
2`55`AC1234 `discomfort.  He has been followed for many years by Dr. Weinerth
2`55`AC1234 `with a history of recurrent nephrolithiasis.  His most recent KUB
2`55`AC1234 `and tomograms performed on 5/11/95 demonstrated a 6 x 4 mm stone in
2`55`AC1234 `the lower pole of the left kidney, as well as three small stones on
2`55`AC1234 `the right side.  The patient noted the onset of acute flank pain
2`55`AC1234 `four days prior to being seen in the clinic on 9/6/95.  When seen,
2`55`AC1234 `he was noted to have microscopic hematuria.  An intravenous
2`55`AC1234 `pyelogram performed on 9/6/95, demonstrated that the 4 x 6 mm stone
2`55`AC1234 `previously in the left lower pole calix had fallen into the left
2`55`AC1234 `distal ureter.  There was delayed function on the left side, but on
2`55`AC1234 `the 15 minute film, there was a column of contrast pointing toward
2`55`AC1234 `the stone in the lower left ureter.  While there was an approximate
2`55`AC1234 `50% chance that the stone would pass spontaneously, he was quite
2`55`AC1234 `concerned since he was scheduled to leave on an extended trip in one
2`55`AC1234 `week's time.  We therefore gave him the option to pass the stone
2`55`AC1234 `spontaneously, but over the past few days, he has not noticed the
2`55`AC1234 `stone passage.  A repeat KUB was performed this morning which
2`55`AC1234 `demonstrated that the stone had moved slightly lower in the distal
2`55`AC1234 `ureter, but still had no passed.  We therefore discussed
2`55`AC1234 `ureteroscopic stone removal, along with its inherent risks and
2`55`AC1234 `possible complications, including incomplete stone removal,
2`55`AC1234 `potential damage to the ureter necessitating open surgery, as well
2`55`AC1234 `as significant blood loss requiring a transfusion.  The patient
2`55`AC1234 `understood and gave his consent.
2`55`AC1234 ` 
2`55`AC1234 `DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was placed on the operating
2`55`AC1234 `room table in a supine position.  Following induction of general
2`55`AC1234 `anesthesia, he was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position, and his
2`55`AC1234 `penis, perineum and scrotum were prepped and draped in a sterile
2`55`AC1234 `fashion.  A #21 French cystoscope sheath with foroblique lens was
2`55`AC1234 `passed directly into the bladder.  Noted just next to the left
2`55`AC1234 `ureteral orifice was the stone, which appeared to have passed
2`55`AC1234 `spontaneously during the anesthetic induction.  A #6 French
2`55`AC1234 `open-ended ureteral stent was then placed into the distal left
2`55`AC1234 `ureter and a gentle retrograde pyelogram performed which
2`55`AC1234 `demonstrated free flow of contrast into the collecting system.
2`55`AC1234 `There was no evidence of residual stone material in the distal left
2`55`AC1234 `ureter, or along the course of the left ureter.  The stone was
2`55`AC1234 `removed without difficulty.  Complete inspection of the bladder with
2`55`AC1234 `both the foroblique and right angle lens demonstrated 3+
2`55`AC1234 `trabeculation with small cellule formation.  The prostate was
2`55`AC1234 `moderately enlarged, causing moderate obstruction at the bladder
2`55`AC1234 `neck.  The bladder was left full of fluid and the cystoscope
2`55`AC1234 `removed.  A #16 French Foley catheter was placed into the bladder
2`55`AC1234 `and hooked to straight drain.  He tolerated the procedure well and
2`55`AC1234 `left for the recovery room in apparently satisfactory condition.

2`56`AC1234 `            Clinic Notes
2`56`AC1234 `                                 ATT:  THOMAS PARKER VAIL, M.D.
2`56`AC1234 ` 
2`56`AC1234 `Procedure:  12/10/97             DICT:
2`56`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson is an 80-year-old Professor Emeritus of general
2`56`AC1234 `surgery from Duke University, who presents for evaluation of left
2`56`AC1234 `knee pain.  He is a very active and vigorous man who enjoys golf,
2`56`AC1234 `tennis and regular exercise in the gym where he lifts weights, rides
2`56`AC1234 `the bike among other things.  He has been having some pain in the
2`56`AC1234 `left knee that is quite minimal.  His real problem is occasional
2`56`AC1234 `giving way of the knee.  He noticed this first when traveling in
2`56`AC1234 `Russia and basically the leg catches and causes him to miss a step.
2`56`AC1234 ` 
2`56`AC1234 `PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Otherwise noncontributory.  He has no cardiac
2`56`AC1234 `or pulmonary history.
2`56`AC1234 ` 
2`56`AC1234 `ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
2`56`AC1234 ` 
2`56`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  He takes aspirin, no other medication.
2`56`AC1234 ` 
2`56`AC1234 `PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a slender, very well-appearing
2`56`AC1234 `80-year-old male with a straight spine, level pelvis, normal gait
2`56`AC1234 `and stance.  Bilateral hip range of movement is full with the
2`56`AC1234 `exception of some limitation in internal rotation to only 10 degrees
2`56`AC1234 `on both sides.
2`56`AC1234 ` 
2`56`AC1234 `X-RAY:  Radiographs of the knee show tricompartment degenerative
2`56`AC1234 `changes with subchondral bone remodeling.  He still has some joint
2`56`AC1234 `space maintained.
2`56`AC1234 ` 
2`56`AC1234 `IMPRESSION:  I think the problem that Dr. Johnson is having is
2`56`AC1234 `mainly a mechanical one where he gets some locking of the irregular
2`56`AC1234 `joint surfaces when he gets in certain positions.  His pain is
2`56`AC1234 `really quite minimal and I have recommended a knee brace with side
2`56`AC1234 `stays which should give him some additional stability.  I have
2`56`AC1234 `talked to him about arthroscopic surgery, which I am not
2`56`AC1234 `recommending at this point in time.  I think it could be done to
2`56`AC1234 `debride the joint, however, since his symptoms are minimal and only
2`56`AC1234 `positional, at this point, I think we can hold off.  His knee is
2`56`AC1234 `clearly too good to be thinking about replacing it.  He is satisfied
2`56`AC1234 `with this plan and will obtain a brace and continue with his
2`56`AC1234 `exercising and see me on an as-needed basis.

2`57`AC1234 ` 
2`57`AC1234 `PRACTITIONER:  Kevin J. Field, C.O.
2`57`AC1234 ` 
2`57`AC1234 `PRESCRIPTION:  The patient presented with a prescription from
2`57`AC1234 `Dr. Thomas Vail for a left knee sleeve, medial lateral hinges.
2`57`AC1234 ` 
2`57`AC1234 `DIAGNOSIS:  The patient has some mild knee instability with history
2`57`AC1234 `of pain in his knee when involved in cutting activities.  This is a
2`57`AC1234 `long-standing overuse type of presentation.
2`57`AC1234 ` 
2`57`AC1234 `ASSESSMENT:  The patient has a somewhat bulbous knee with no edema.
2`57`AC1234 `The patient states that he plays tennis at least 2 x a week and
2`57`AC1234 `stays very active and he states that he has had episodes where his
2`57`AC1234 `knee felt stable and almost buckled on him due to lack of support.
2`57`AC1234 `Other than that, the patient appears to have normal strength and
2`57`AC1234 `range of motion at the knee.
2`57`AC1234 ` 
2`57`AC1234 `PLAN:  The plan is to measure and fit the patient with a knee sleeve
2`57`AC1234 `with medial lateral hinges.  This knee sleeve will provide warmth to
2`57`AC1234 `the area, medial lateral stability and generalized circumferential
2`57`AC1234 `support to his left knee.
2`57`AC1234 ` 
2`57`AC1234 `SERVICE:  The patient was measured and fit with a size medium Donjoy
2`57`AC1234 `Econo-hinged knee orthosis.  The fit of the knee sleeve went well.
2`57`AC1234 `The patient stated that it felt comfortable and supportive.  I did
2`57`AC1234 `some contouring to the medial upright to relieve contact with this
2`57`AC1234 `patient's bulbous knee.  After doing so, the patient stated that it
2`57`AC1234 `felt comfortable and supportive.
2`57`AC1234 ` 
2`57`AC1234 `EDUCATION:  The patient was given a written handout as well as
2`57`AC1234 `verbal instructions on donning, doffing and care for the knee
2`57`AC1234 `sleeve.
2`57`AC1234 ` 
2`57`AC1234 `RETURN APPOINTMENT:  We will follow up with the patient on a p.r.n.
2`57`AC1234 `basis along with his follow-ups with Dr. Vail.

2`58`AC1234 `Personal Data:
2`58`AC1234 `DOB:  11/26/1917
2`58`AC1234 ` 
2`58`AC1234 `Referring Physician:  Dr. Nancy Allen
2`58`AC1234 `        Box 2440 - DUMC
2`58`AC1234 ` 
2`58`AC1234 `History of Present Illness:  Dr. Johnson is a very healthy 82-year-old
2`58`AC1234 `physician here who has a most interesting story.  He has a history of
2`58`AC1234 `arthritis and renal calculi, but in July of this year, he had a sensation
2`58`AC1234 `in his head the day after he had had some alcohol at a party.  The
2`58`AC1234 `sensation lasted 2-3 minutes and occurred every hour for about 48 hours
2`58`AC1234 `and then resolved.  There was no pain involved, no numbness.  He just felt
2`58`AC1234 `unusual in his head for a short period of time.  He was completely awake
2`58`AC1234 `and alert.  He has no numbness or tingling, or any other symptoms and he
2`58`AC1234 `felt he could function entirely during or through the event and was not
2`58`AC1234 `amnestic for it.  He does feel somewhat chilly inside.
2`58`AC1234 ` 
2`58`AC1234 `He forgot this and did not pay anymore attention to it.  He had a CT scan
2`58`AC1234 `requested by Nancy Allen in September, 1999 which was pretty normal,
2`58`AC1234 `except for a small vessel disease.  However, he again went out and had a
2`58`AC1234 `few drinks and the next day had the episode occur again last week.  This
2`58`AC1234 `was fairly short lived and again has now totally resolved after 48 hours.
2`58`AC1234 `He has had alcohol at other times without it being a precipitant and it
2`58`AC1234 `may not be involved at all.  Again, he was completely awake and alert
2`58`AC1234 `during these episodes and knows what is happening, but has no other
2`58`AC1234 `associated symptoms and he is not clear what this means either.
2`58`AC1234 ` 
2`58`AC1234 `He is on no medication. There is no history of seizures.  He has no
2`58`AC1234 `history of severe head trauma.
2`58`AC1234 ` 
2`58`AC1234 `Family History:  Negative for similar events.
2`58`AC1234 ` 
2`58`AC1234 `Social History:  He remains active.  He plays tennis a great deal.
2`58`AC1234 ` 
2`58`AC1234 `Neurological Examination:  On examination, he is alert and oriented.  His
2`58`AC1234 `visual fields are full.  Funduscopic exam is intact.  Hearing is markedly
2`58`AC1234 `reduced bilaterally.  There are no bruits over his head or his neck and
2`58`AC1234 `there is no cardiac murmurs.  Pulse is regular.  He is not aware of any
2`58`AC1234 `palpitations.  His neurologic exam shows good strength and symmetric
2`58`AC1234 `reflexes.  Plantar reflexes are flexor.  No pathologic reflexes and no
2`58`AC1234 `ataxia.  Sensation is intact.
2`58`AC1234 ` 
2`58`AC1234 `Assessment/Plan: I do not know what Dr. Johnson is having.  I'm hoping
2`58`AC1234 `it is nothing serious and I guess, if it happens again, we should try to
2`58`AC1234 `do an EEG during one of these in case it is some unusual seizure, but I
2`58`AC1234 `really think it would be quite unusual.  Also, I guess it is possible he
2`58`AC1234 `could have some form of arrhythmia and if it happens again, he is going to
2`58`AC1234 `check his pulse regularly, although that is not highly likely either.  He
2`58`AC1234 `has had thyroid studies.  He has had a sed rate of 22.  A headache is
2`58`AC1234 `really not a part of this anyway.
2`58`AC1234 ` 
2`58`AC1234 `I do not know exactly what these events are. We will try to capture some
2`58`AC1234 `electrical activity if it occurs again.

2`59`AC1234 ` 
2`59`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson comes in today because of the lesion on his right cheek,
2`59`AC1234 `which is apparently growing.
2`59`AC1234 ` 
2`59`AC1234 `On exam there is a flesh colored papule there.
2`59`AC1234 ` 
2`59`AC1234 `I talked to him about the differential diagnosis at length and really the
2`59`AC1234 `only way to find out what that might be is to do a biopsy.
2`59`AC1234 ` 
2`59`AC1234 `With his permission, we infiltrated this lesion with Xylocaine and did a
2`59`AC1234 `4 mm. punch biopsy.  The specimen was submitted for histopathologic exam.
2`59`AC1234 `Post operative wound care instructions were given.  His wife will take his
2`59`AC1234 `sutures out in a week.  If he has any problems or difficulties in the
2`59`AC1234 `meantime he will let us know.

2`60`AC1234 ` 
2`60`AC1234 `ALLERGIES:
2`60`AC1234 `No known drug or food allergies
2`60`AC1234 ` 
2`60`AC1234 `CLINICAL HISTORY:
2`60`AC1234 `The patient is an 82 year old semi-retired Surgical Professor.  He
2`60`AC1234 `continues to work the Cancer Center.  Medical issues are as outlined in
2`60`AC1234 `the problem list.  He has enjoyed generally good health over the years.
2`60`AC1234 `He remains quite active, playing tennis several times per week and
2`60`AC1234 `exercises up to 1 mile several times per week.  He has noted no change in
2`60`AC1234 `his exercise tolerance.  He experiences no cardiac symptoms and no
2`60`AC1234 `claudication symptoms.
2`60`AC1234 ` 
2`60`AC1234 `His primary concern at this time is CNS symptoms.  Apparently he had
2`60`AC1234 `non-specific head fullness in 11/99 and was seen by Dr. Massey.  At that
2`60`AC1234 `time there was no neurologic findings.  He had had a previous MRI on
2`60`AC1234 `9/29/99 which demonstrated chronic small vessel ischemic changes with no
2`60`AC1234 `acute changes.  Approximately 1 month ago he had a 30 minute episode of
2`60`AC1234 `acute confusion with disorientation as to time, place, and person.  He
2`60`AC1234 `subsequently underwent an MRI showing chronic small vessel ischemic
2`60`AC1234 `changes.  He feels that there has been some chronic memory loss for recent
2`60`AC1234 `events over the last month or so.  Since the event he will have some
2`60`AC1234 `occasional difficulty with location when driving.  Recent memory seems to
2`60`AC1234 `be OK.  He has had no focal neurologic symptoms.
2`60`AC1234 `

2`61`AC1234 `                                 ATT:  ROBERTS H. A. SMITH, M.D.
2`61`AC1234 ` 
2`61`AC1234 `Procedure:  06/14/00             DICT:
2`61`AC1234 `ACCOUNT NUMBER:  747621
2`61`AC1234 ` 
2`61`AC1234 `CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Neurologic evaluation.
2`61`AC1234 ` 
2`61`AC1234 `HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 82-year-old retired physician who
2`61`AC1234 `had an episode of confusion now twice in the last three weeks.  He
2`61`AC1234 `was seen by Dr. Strittmatter previously for this.  Has had MRIs now
2`61`AC1234 `x 2 to evaluate that.  The most recent episode was two days, lasting
2`61`AC1234 `about six hours, reportedly he was confused but otherwise
2`61`AC1234 `neurologically intact.  He was advised to come here by his
2`61`AC1234 `neurologist to be seen by the neurology resident today.  He is
2`61`AC1234 `having no symptoms today.
2`61`AC1234 ` 
2`61`AC1234 `REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Has not had any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
2`61`AC1234 `shortness of breath, chest pain or focal neurologic complaints.
2`61`AC1234 ` 
2`61`AC1234 `PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Basically benign.  He had a lumbar disc
2`61`AC1234 `surgery in 1988 and kidney stone in 1997.  Has mild hyperlipidemia
2`61`AC1234 `and has had a cataract procedure as well.
2`61`AC1234 ` 
2`61`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, multivitamins, vitamin C and vitamin
2`61`AC1234 `E.  He is getting testosterone injections.
2`61`AC1234 ` 
2`61`AC1234 `PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At presentation (he was seen at
2`61`AC1234 `presentation), awake, alert, oriented, and ambulatory.  His speech
2`61`AC1234 `is clear.  He is intermittently tearful during the exam.  Temp 37.6,
2`61`AC1234 `heart rate 77 regular, blood pressure 183/89 and respiratory rate
2`61`AC1234 `14, not labored.  Neurologic exam: His gait is fairly steady but
2`61`AC1234 `heel toe walking is quite difficult for him.  He has difficulty with
2`61`AC1234 `certain coordination such as alternating hand clapping, cannot
2`61`AC1234 `demonstrate any other posterior signs.  Cranial nerves II-XII were
2`61`AC1234 `intact and symmetric.  Funduscopic exam: No papilledema, hemorrhage
2`61`AC1234 `or exudate.  The oropharynx was well-hydrated and well-perfused.
2`61`AC1234 `Cardiac exam regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or
2`61`AC1234 `gallops.  Carotids without bruit.  Lungs clear.
2`61`AC1234 ` 
2`61`AC1234 `EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE AND MEDICAL DECISION MAKING:  I reviewed
2`61`AC1234 `his previous workup which includes MRI showing small vessel disease.
2`61`AC1234 `Consulted neurology (see their note for details).  Neurology has
2`61`AC1234 `recommended screening laboratories and followup with Dr.
2`61`AC1234 `Strittmatter in clinic.  I certainly agree with that.
2`61`AC1234 ` 
2`61`AC1234 `DIAGNOSIS:  Confusion, possible transient ischemic attack versus
2`61`AC1234 `dementia.

2`62`AC1234 `REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Smith
2`62`AC1234 `STUDY #: 00-0977
2`62`AC1234 `AGE/SEX:  82 y/o M
2`62`AC1234 `WARD: NER
2`62`AC1234 ` 
2`62`AC1234 `HISTORY: The patient is an 82 y/o male with a history of arthritis and
2`62`AC1234 `kidney stones but no other significant medical history who presents with a
2`62`AC1234 `several month history of poor memory and brief episodes of a abnormal
2`62`AC1234 `sensation in his head lasting several minutes.
2`62`AC1234 ` 
2`62`AC1234 `REPORT:   This is a digitally acquired adult EEG following the standard
2`62`AC1234 `10/20 system of electrode placement. The best background activity seen in
2`62`AC1234 `this tracing is an 8 Hz activity that has an amplitude of 30 uV, is
2`62`AC1234 `symmetric bilaterally and reactive to eye opening. Brief intermittent
2`62`AC1234 `generalized slowing is seen throughout the record as well. Early in the
2`62`AC1234 `record paroxysmal rhythmic sharp wave activity was seen in the right
2`62`AC1234 `temporal region with sharp waves occurring at frequency of 1-2 Hz with an
2`62`AC1234 `amplitude of approximately 40 uV that lasted for 5-6 sec and was followed
2`62`AC1234 `by 10-15 sec of right temporal diffuse rhythmic alpha activity with an
2`62`AC1234 `amplitude of 20 uV that slowed into the theta range from about 8 Hz to 4
2`62`AC1234 `Hz and then stopped. There was no clear clinical correlate to this
2`62`AC1234 `rhythmic activity. Rare left fronto temporal sharp waves were also noted
2`62`AC1234 `and these phase reversed at the F7 electrode and had amplitudes of 30 uV.
2`62`AC1234 `The patient was awake and later drowsy during this study but did not fall
2`62`AC1234 `asleep.
2`62`AC1234 ` 
2`62`AC1234 ` 
2`62`AC1234 `INTERPRETATION: This is an abnormal adult EEG  due to:
2`62`AC1234 ` 
2`62`AC1234 `1) A paroxysmal burst of rhythmic activity in the right temporal region.
2`62`AC1234 ` 
2`62`AC1234 `2) Rare left fronto temporal sharp waves.
2`62`AC1234 ` 
2`62`AC1234 `3) Diffuse slowing of the EEG background and brief intermittent
2`62`AC1234 `generalized slowing.
2`62`AC1234 ` 
2`62`AC1234 `CLINICAL CORRELATION: The brief burst of paroxysmal rhythmic activity
2`62`AC1234 `seen across the right temporal region may represent a subclinical seizure
2`62`AC1234 `or may represent subclinical rhythmic electrographic discharge of adults
2`62`AC1234 `which does not have any correlation with clinical seizures. These two
2`62`AC1234 `possibilities are difficult to distinguish in this brief EEG record. The
2`62`AC1234 `rare left fronto temporal sharp wave discharges are of unclear clinical
2`62`AC1234 `significance as well. The diffuse slowing of the EEG background is
2`62`AC1234 `consistent with mild diffuse neuronal dysfunction and is otherwise a
2`62`AC1234 `nonspecific finding.

2`64`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson, his wife and 3 family members come to clinic today for
2`64`AC1234 `follow up.  Dr. Johnson was last seen by me on June 19, 2000 and the
2`64`AC1234 `complete history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging
2`64`AC1234 `studies are summarized in my previous notes.  Dr. Johnson had
2`64`AC1234 `neuropsych testing performed by Dr. Kathy welsh-Bohmer.  The complete
2`64`AC1234 `results of the neuropsychological testing are in the clinic chart note.
2`64`AC1234 `In summary, the neuropsych testing demonstrated findings consistent with a
2`64`AC1234 `mild stage of dementia in a gentleman with a high cognitive reserve.  We
2`64`AC1234 `discussed at length each of the individual tests and the results of the
2`64`AC1234 `neuropsych testing.  I emphasized to the patient and to his family that
2`64`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson had significant problems with memory and cognition.  I am
2`64`AC1234 `recommending that he see Dr. Koltai for her Memory Enhancement Program and
2`64`AC1234 `Dr. David Steffens for evaluation of his mood lability.
2`64`AC1234 ` 
2`64`AC1234 `We also talked about reporting to the DMV to assess his driving status.
2`64`AC1234 ` 
2`64`AC1234 `The diagnosis at present is cognitive loss and the patient will be
2`64`AC1234 `followed for any progression.
2`64`AC1234 ` 
2`64`AC1234 `He will return to clinic to see me in six months.

2`65`AC1234 `HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
2`65`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson and his wife return to clinic today for a follow-up visit.
2`65`AC1234 ` He was last seen by me on 8/7/2000.  He has a diagnosis of mild cognitive
2`65`AC1234 `decline, as documented by neuropsychological testing and by my previous
2`65`AC1234 `assessment.  Since the last clinic visit, there has been little change in
2`65`AC1234 `his cognitive or functional status according to the patient and his wife.
2`65`AC1234 `He remains physically active, playing tennis once a week and exercising
2`65`AC1234 `approximately 3 times a week.  He continues to read magazines, newspapers,
2`65`AC1234 `and books.  He has an active travel schedule this summer.  He has been
2`65`AC1234 `seen by Dr. Nancy Allen on 9/11/2000 and her note is in the clinic chart.
2`65`AC1234 `Current medications consist of ibuprofen and 1 baby aspirin a day.  He is
2`65`AC1234 `also taking vitamin E 800 IU a day.  On MMSE testing today he scored a
2`65`AC1234 `total of 25.  Dr. Johnson will return to clinic to see me in October
2`65`AC1234 `when he returns from his trips.  At that time we will probably reorder
2`65`AC1234 `neuropsychological testing.  The patient will return to clinic then but
2`65`AC1234 `will return earlier if he requests

2`67`AC1234 `IMAGING STUDIES:  None.
2`67`AC1234 ` 
2`67`AC1234 `PROCEDURES:       After written consent, a fine needle aspirate of
2`67`AC1234 `his left axillary lymph node was obtained by pathology.
2`67`AC1234 ` 
2`67`AC1234 `IMPRESSION:
2`67`AC1234 `1. Lymphadenopathy.
2`67`AC1234 `   a. Noted enlarged axillary lymph nodes on routine physical exam,
2`67`AC1234 `      3/15/01.
2`67`AC1234 `   b. Fine needle aspirate of left axillary lymph node.
2`67`AC1234 `2. Transient memory loss, MRI 9/99 revealed small vessel ischemic
2`67`AC1234 `changes.
2`67`AC1234 `3. Lumbar disk disease, status post lumbar disk surgery in 1988.
2`67`AC1234 `4. History of renal calculi, treated with lithotripsy, 9/97.
2`67`AC1234 `5. Renal insufficiency, creatinine since 1995 1.5, now 2.0.

2`67`AC1234 ` 
2`67`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:      Dr. Moore examined Mr. Johnson today and noted
2`67`AC1234 `a 2 cm palpable supraclavicular node, as well as a 2 cm inguinal
2`67`AC1234 `lymph node in addition to his axillary lymph node.  In consulting
2`67`AC1234 `with Dr. Johnson, he feels that he has noticed this node in his
2`67`AC1234 `cervical chain for many years without any changes in this.
2`67`AC1234 ` 
2`67`AC1234 `Pathology from his fine needle aspirate is not available at this
2`67`AC1234 `time and preliminary was not able to be diagnosed in clinic.  It is
2`67`AC1234 `a possibility that Dr. Johnson will not have to undergo an
2`67`AC1234 `excision of this lymph node for diagnosis.
2`67`AC1234 ` 
2`67`AC1234 `Dr. Moore discussed with Dr. Johnson the fact that he might have
2`67`AC1234 `to undergo a surgical excision of this as we might not have a
2`67`AC1234 `diagnosis.  Discussed with him the possible _________ for diagnosis
2`67`AC1234 `including lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease.
2`67`AC1234 ` 
2`67`AC1234 `As Dr. Johnson is going out of town for the next 10 days, we will
2`67`AC1234 `have him return to clinic after this and we will get a chest,
2`67`AC1234 `abdomen and pelvis CT, as well as a PET scan on 3/29.
2`67`AC1234 ` 
2`67`AC1234 `Then he will be seen and evaluated by Dr. Moore on 4/2 when
2`67`AC1234 `hopefully we will have a diagnosis at that time or we will arrange
2`67`AC1234 `for a surgical excision.
2`67`AC1234 ` 
2`67`AC1234 `PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN:  None.

2`68`AC1234 `INTERVAL NOTE
2`68`AC1234 ` 
2`68`AC1234 `INTERVAL HISTORY:  Dr. Johnson returns for followup evaluation of
2`68`AC1234 `his lymph node enlargement and following his most recent studies
2`68`AC1234 `including CT scans and a PET scan.
2`68`AC1234 ` 
2`68`AC1234 `The initial fine-needle aspiration in the left axillary node
2`68`AC1234 `suggested a small population of abnormal B-cells consistent with
2`68`AC1234 `malignant lymphoma but not diagnostic of the same.  He returns now
2`68`AC1234 `for followup evaluation and for further treatment planning.
2`68`AC1234 ` 
2`68`AC1234 `He has been doing some traveling and his symptoms have not changed
2`68`AC1234 `at all from his evaluation of 3/16/01 which should be referred to.
2`68`AC1234 ` 
2`68`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.  2. Multivitamin
2`68`AC1234 `p.o. q.d.  3. Vitamin C and vitamin E q.d.  4. Normal saline mouth
2`68`AC1234 `wash.
2`68`AC1234 ` 
2`68`AC1234 `PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight 78.7 kg, temperature 37.4, pulse
2`68`AC1234 `106 and regular, respirations 16 and regular, blood pressure 150/75.
2`68`AC1234 `The exam is completely performed today and is not changed from that
2`68`AC1234 `described in  his 3/16 note which again should be referred to.
2`68`AC1234 ` 
2`68`AC1234 `LABORATORY DATA:  (attach).  White cell differential will be added
2`68`AC1234 `by Dr. Moore.
2`68`AC1234 ` 
2`68`AC1234 `IMAGING STUDIES:  (transport CT and PET).
2`68`AC1234 ` 
2`68`AC1234 `PROCEDURES:  Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed today.
2`68`AC1234 `Bone marrow aspiration reveals a cellular marrow with megakaryocytes
2`68`AC1234 `present.  All marrow elements are present.  There is an increase in
2`68`AC1234 `lymphoid cells.  Bone marrow biopsy (attach).
2`68`AC1234 ` 
2`68`AC1234 `IMPRESSION:  (transport)
2`68`AC1234 ` 
2`68`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  I have had a long discussion today with
2`68`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson, his wife, Jane, and his daughter, Betty, both of
2`68`AC1234 `whom accompanied him to the clinic today.  I have gone over at the
2`68`AC1234 `view box all of his CTs and PET scans and have discussed and have
2`68`AC1234 `myself performed a bone marrow as noted above.
2`68`AC1234 ` 
2`68`AC1234 `It is my view that he has a malignant lymphoma and that he will
2`68`AC1234 `require treatment for this.  I have gone over the types of lymphoma
2`68`AC1234 `and we have gone over the framework of treatment in that this will
2`68`AC1234 `almost certainly require at least chemotherapy if not chemotherapy
2`68`AC1234 `combined with a targeted anti-CD20 antibody and these plans will be
2`68`AC1234 `solidified when he returns.
2`68`AC1234 ` 
2`68`AC1234 `I have personally spoken with Dr. Doug Tyler today and he will see
2`68`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson in his clinic later on the day of this visit (4/2/01)
2`68`AC1234 `with the plan that a lymph node biopsy for more definitive
2`68`AC1234 `characterization of his lymphoma will be performed on 4/3/01.  When
2`68`AC1234 `these results are complete, we will establish a treatment course.

2`69`AC1234 ` 
2`69`AC1234 `DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was obtained, the
2`69`AC1234 `patient was brought to the operating room of Duke University Medical
2`69`AC1234 `Center on 4/3/01, and placed in supine position on the operating
2`69`AC1234 `table with the left arm extended.  IV sedation was given.  The left
2`69`AC1234 `axilla and chest were prepped and draped as a sterile field using
2`69`AC1234 `DuraPrep solution.  An incision was made approximately 5 cm in
2`69`AC1234 `length in the left axilla and dissection was carried down through
2`69`AC1234 `subcutaneous tissues using electrocautery.  The adenopathy was
2`69`AC1234 `easily palpable and this was dissected using sharp dissection with
2`69`AC1234 `the Bovie electrocautery.  Where lymphatic channels were seen, these
2`69`AC1234 `were clipped using small vascular clips.  The enlarged lymph node
2`69`AC1234 `measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter was then delivered into the
2`69`AC1234 `wound and was excised.   This was sent to pathology.  Inspection was
2`69`AC1234 `performed for hemostasis and irrigation was performed.  The wound
2`69`AC1234 `was then repaired in layers, including a running subcuticular suture
2`69`AC1234 `in the skin.  This completed the operation.  Dr. Tyler was present
2`69`AC1234 `and participated in all aspects.

2`70`AC1234 `INTERVAL NOTE
2`70`AC1234 ` 
2`70`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson returns for followup evaluation and further treatment
2`70`AC1234 `planning of his lymph node enlargement now considered to be a large
2`70`AC1234 `B cell lymphoma probably arising out of a preexisting or previous
2`70`AC1234 `follicular lymphoma which was not clinically apparent.
2`70`AC1234 ` 
2`70`AC1234 `He is accompanied today by his wife, Jane, his daughter, Betty, and
2`70`AC1234 `his son, Bruce, all of whom were present during the entire exam and
2`70`AC1234 `discussion.
2`70`AC1234 ` 
2`70`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.  2. Multiple
2`70`AC1234 `vitamin p.o. q.d.  3. Vitamin C p.o. q.d.  4. Vitamin E p.o. q.d.
2`70`AC1234 `5. Sodium chloride oral mouthwash.
2`70`AC1234 ` 
2`70`AC1234 `His son Bruce notes that he has specifically noted deterioration in
2`70`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson's cognitive faculties and noted marked increase in
2`70`AC1234 `confusion and disorientation since he saw him about one month ago. I
2`70`AC1234 `would agree with this and feel that this may well be related to his
2`70`AC1234 `calcium.  He has been in touch with Dr. Warren Strittmatter who has
2`70`AC1234 `seen Dr. Johnson before because of some memory deficit disorder
2`70`AC1234 `and Dr. Strittmatter has recommended a CT scan which we will move
2`70`AC1234 `ahead with.  I would note that his PET scan revealed no specific
2`70`AC1234 `abnormality and I doubt seriously we will find anything but do feel
2`70`AC1234 `that this is entirely appropriate.

2`70`AC1234 `   c. Left axillary lymph node biopsy-02/03/01.
2`70`AC1234 ` 
2`70`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  I had a very long discussion with the patient and his
2`70`AC1234 `family concerning the diagnosis and they are well aware of the fact
2`70`AC1234 `that he has extensive disease at least stage III for the large-cell
2`70`AC1234 `and perhaps stage IV for the follicular lymphoma.
2`70`AC1234 ` 
2`70`AC1234 `My first concern is the calcium and I have elected to move ahead
2`70`AC1234 `today with pamidronate 90 mg IV.  His son Bruce is aware of the
2`70`AC1234 `kidney lesion and that this may relate to the hypercalcemia but we
2`70`AC1234 `would like to see if he improves with regard to his mental status
2`70`AC1234 `with lowering the calcium.  This will be done today.
2`70`AC1234 ` 
2`70`AC1234 `We will go ahead with a brain CT scan and with a rest MUGA scan.
2`70`AC1234 ` 
2`70`AC1234 `He will return on 04/09 and will initiate rituxan 375 mg sq m IV
2`70`AC1234 `with half given on the first and half the second day.  On the second
2`70`AC1234 `day he will receive multiagent chemotherapy with Cytoxan 500 mg sq m
2`70`AC1234 `IV, Novantrone 10 mg sq m IV, vincristine 1.0 mg IV and prednisone
2`70`AC1234 `100 mg p.o. each day for five days.  We will plan a total of six
2`70`AC1234 `cycles but will break after two or three cycles for reevaluation by
2`70`AC1234 `CT scan.
2`70`AC1234 ` 
2`70`AC1234 `I have discussed the potential benefits and risks in detail as well
2`70`AC1234 `as all side effects associated with these drugs.  Will move ahead as
2`70`AC1234 `soon as possible.  I think that the family understands these
2`70`AC1234 `findings and this approach.

2`71`AC1234 `Procedure:  04/09/01             DICT: MARY S. MALICKI, R.N.
2`71`AC1234 `INTERVAL NOTE
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson is an 83-year-old Caucasian male newly diagnosed
2`71`AC1234 `large B-cell lymphoma.  He comes to clinic today for beginning of
2`71`AC1234 `his treatment of Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy.
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson was seen by Dr. Moore on Friday to give the diagnosis
2`71`AC1234 `of his lymphoma, as well as a treatment plan.  At that time, he was
2`71`AC1234 `noted to be somewhat somnolent, although arousable.  It was noted
2`71`AC1234 `that his calcium was elevated and he was treated with pamidronate.
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 `In clinic today, although he is quiet, he much more alert than he
2`71`AC1234 `was in clinic on Friday.  He is accompanied by his wife, Jane, who
2`71`AC1234 `has multiple questions in regard to their treatment planning; mainly
2`71`AC1234 `all dealing around scheduling.
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 `Dr. Moore has outlined a treatment plan with Rituxan and CNOP
2`71`AC1234 `chemotherapy to begin today and this would be done every three to
2`71`AC1234 `four weeks for a total of six cycles, but will take a break for
2`71`AC1234 `reevaluation of CT scan after his second or third cycle.
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 `He is scheduled to undergo a resting MUGA at the end of this week,
2`71`AC1234 `as well as a brain CT just to rule out any further neurological
2`71`AC1234 `problems.
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 `His only complaint today is a decreased appetite, as well as a dry
2`71`AC1234 `hacky cough.  He has also scheduled a root canal on 4/18 and is
2`71`AC1234 `asking whether they should still go ahead with this.
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg q.d., multivitamin q.d.,
2`71`AC1234 `vitamin C q.d., vitamin E q.d., sodium chloride oral mouthwash.
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 `PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
2`71`AC1234 `

2`71`AC1234 `  d. Initiation Rituxan CNOP chemotherapy, 4/9/01.
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  Dr. Johnson will go to the treatment room to begin
2`71`AC1234 `his first of his split dose of Rituxan.  He will receive 300 mg
2`71`AC1234 `today based on 300 mg/sq m and to return tomorrow for his second
2`71`AC1234 `split of 400 mg.  Also at that time, he will receive CNOP
2`71`AC1234 `chemotherapy, Cytoxan 500 mg/sq m for a total of 1000 mg,
2`71`AC1234 `mitoxantrone 10 mg/sq m for a total of 20 mg, vincristine 1 mg/sq m
2`71`AC1234 `for 2 mg.  He was given a prescription for prednisone 20 mg to take
2`71`AC1234 `five tablets q.d. every day for five days beginning 4/10.
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 `Given the fact he has an elevated creatinine, Dr. Moore has elected
2`71`AC1234 `to start him on allopurinol and he was given a prescription for
2`71`AC1234 `300 mg q.d.  He was also given a prescription for _________ to take
2`71`AC1234 `8 mg p.o. q.12h. for 48 hours after his chemotherapy.
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 `He will return to clinic in one week for further evaluation of his
2`71`AC1234 `counts, as well as evaluation of his creatinine.  He will return to
2`71`AC1234 `clinic in three weeks for planned initiation of his second cycle of
2`71`AC1234 `chemotherapy.
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 ` 
2`71`AC1234 `I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and
2`71`AC1234 `concur with the above findings.

2`72`AC1234 `HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS/CHIEF COMPLAINT:
2`72`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson is an 83 year old white male who is S/P left axillary
2`72`AC1234 `dissection yesterday.  He tolerated his surgery well, had a drain in place
2`72`AC1234 `which has put out about 10 cc's.  He has had some mild discomfort but
2`72`AC1234 `otherwise no significant problems.
2`72`AC1234 ` 
2`72`AC1234 `PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
2`72`AC1234 `His axillary incision is clean, dry, and intact.  The drain is also
2`72`AC1234 `intact and has about 8cc's of serosanguineous fluid.
2`72`AC1234 ` 
2`72`AC1234 `ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
2`72`AC1234 `Left axillary biopsy.  We will put another vacutainer on the wound just
2`72`AC1234 `to minimize the chance that Dr. Johnson forms a seroma.  We will remove
2`72`AC1234 `the drain tomorrow prior to his seeing Dr. Moore.

2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson returns for followup evaluation and further treatment
2`73`AC1234 `planning of his lymph node enlargement now considered to be a large
2`73`AC1234 `B cell lymphoma probably arising out of a preexisting or previous
2`73`AC1234 `follicular lymphoma which was not clinically apparent.
2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `He is accompanied today by his wife, Jane, his daughter, Betty, and
2`73`AC1234 `his son, Bruce, all of whom were present during the entire exam and
2`73`AC1234 `discussion.
2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
2`73`AC1234 `1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2`73`AC1234 ` 2. Multiple vitamin p.o. q.d.
2`73`AC1234 `3. Vitamin C p.o. q.d.

2`73`AC1234 `5. Sodium chloride oral mouthwash.
2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `His son Bruce notes that he has specifically noted deterioration in
2`73`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson's cognitive faculties and noted marked increase in
2`73`AC1234 `confusion and disorientation since he saw him about one month ago. I
2`73`AC1234 `would agree with this and feel that this may well be related to his
2`73`AC1234 `calcium.  He has been in touch with Dr. Warren Strittmatter who has
2`73`AC1234 `seen Dr. Johnson before because of some memory deficit disorder
2`73`AC1234 `and Dr. Strittmatter has recommended a CT scan which we will move
2`73`AC1234 `ahead with.  I would note that his PET scan revealed no specific
2`73`AC1234 `abnormality and I doubt seriously we will find anything but do feel
2`73`AC1234 `that this is entirely appropriate.
2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
2`73`AC1234 `Peripheral blood: A Wright-stained peripheral blood smear is evaluated in
2`73`AC1234 `conjunction with an automated blood count. The red cells, white cells,
2`73`AC1234 `and
2`73`AC1234 `platelets are all normal in number and morphology (HGB-11.2, PLT-282,
2`73`AC1234 `WBC-9.4). No abnormal lymphoid cells are seen.
2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `Bone marrow aspirate: A few particles are seen on the aspirate smear,
2`73`AC1234 `some of
2`73`AC1234 `which are hypercellular which may represent lymphoid aggregates. The M:E
2`73`AC1234 `ratio
2`73`AC1234 `is increased (12:1) by manual count, but this may not be accurate due to
2`73`AC1234 `hemodilution. The myeloid and erythroid maturation are both adequate.
2`73`AC1234 `Lymphocytes are not increased comprising 5%. They are morphologically
2`73`AC1234 `normal.
2`73`AC1234 `Megakaryocytes are adequate in morphology.
2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `The bone marrow touch preparation shows similar findings.
2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `The iron stain on the aspirate smear shows increased iron.
2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `Bone marrow core biopsy: The cellularity of the core biopsy is variable,
2`73`AC1234 `ranging from 30 to 80%. Multiple lymphoid aggregates are present
2`73`AC1234 `involving 20%
2`73`AC1234 `of the marrow. The aggregates are represented by mostly paratrabecular
2`73`AC1234 `location. One large aggregate shows expansion into the interstitial
2`73`AC1234 `marrow.
2`73`AC1234 `The aggregates consist of mostly small cells with elongated and cleaved
2`73`AC1234 `nuclei
2`73`AC1234 `intermixed with a few larger transformed cells. The M:E ratio is about
2`73`AC1234 `4:1.

2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
2`73`AC1234 `Sections show mostly effaced normal architecture of the lymph node. Vague
2`73`AC1234 `nodularity is present.  A few residual lymphoid follicles are seen at the
2`73`AC1234 `periphery.  The lymph node is almost entirely replaced by a diffuse
2`73`AC1234 `infiltration of large cells.  These cells show centroblast morphology
2`73`AC1234 `with
2`73`AC1234 `large round and slightly irregular nuclei, several small distinct
2`73`AC1234 `nucleoli,
2`73`AC1234 `and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Fibrosis is present in
2`73`AC1234 `the
2`73`AC1234 `trabecular pattern.  Mitotic figures are increased.  On section A5,
2`73`AC1234 `focally
2`73`AC1234 `there are increased number of abnormal lymphoid follicles.  The follicles
2`73`AC1234 `contain large number of large cells with some intermixed small cleaved
2`73`AC1234 `cells.

2`73`AC1234 `COMMENT:
2`73`AC1234 `ADDENDUM 1:
2`73`AC1234 `This addendum is issued to report immunoperoxidase stain results. The
2`73`AC1234 `diagnosis remains unchanged.
2`73`AC1234 `CD20, CD3, CD21 are performed on block A4, and CD20, CD3, CD10, Bcl-2 are
2`73`AC1234 `performed on block A5. There is a small focus of grade III follicular
2`73`AC1234 `lymphoma
2`73`AC1234 `present on block A5 as coexpression of CD20, CD10, and Bcl-2 is
2`73`AC1234 `identified
2`73`AC1234 `within the germinal centers. This finding suggests that the large cell
2`73`AC1234 `lymphoma is most likely arising from a pre-existing follicular lymphoma.

2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  I had a very long discussion with the patient and his
2`73`AC1234 `family concerning the diagnosis and they are well aware of the fact
2`73`AC1234 `that he has extensive disease at least stage III for the large-cell
2`73`AC1234 `and perhaps stage IV for the follicular lymphoma.
2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `My first concern is the calcium and I have elected to move ahead
2`73`AC1234 `today with pamidronate 90 mg IV.  His son Bruce is aware of the
2`73`AC1234 `kidney lesion and that this may relate to the hypercalcemia but we
2`73`AC1234 `would like to see if he improves with regard to his mental status
2`73`AC1234 `with lowering the calcium.  This will be done today.
2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `We will go ahead with a brain CT scan and with a rest MUGA scan.
2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `He will return on 04/09 and will initiate rituxan 375 mg sq m IV
2`73`AC1234 `with half given on the first and half the second day.  On the second
2`73`AC1234 `day he will receive multiagent chemotherapy with Cytoxan 500 mg sq m
2`73`AC1234 `IV, Novantrone 10 mg sq m IV, vincristine 1.0 mg IV and prednisone
2`73`AC1234 `100 mg p.o. each day for five days.  We will plan a total of six
2`73`AC1234 `cycles but will break after two or three cycles for reevaluation by
2`73`AC1234 `CT scan.
2`73`AC1234 ` 
2`73`AC1234 `I have discussed the potential benefits and risks in detail as well
2`73`AC1234 `as all side effects associated with these drugs.  Will move ahead as
2`73`AC1234 `soon as possible.  I think that the family understands these
2`73`AC1234 `findings and this approach.

2`74`AC1234 `his lymph node enlargement and following his most recent studies
2`74`AC1234 `including CT scans and a PET scan.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `The initial fine-needle aspiration in the left axillary node
2`74`AC1234 `suggested a small population of abnormal B-cells consistent with
2`74`AC1234 `malignant lymphoma but not diagnostic of the same.  He returns now
2`74`AC1234 `for followup evaluation and for further treatment planning.

2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `Technique: Contiguous axial images from the lung apices to the pubic
2`74`AC1234 `symphysis following the uneventful intravenous administration of 150
2`74`AC1234 `cc of Isovue-300 at 3 cc cc/sec. Oral contrast was also given. Field
2`74`AC1234 `of view: 34 cm. Creatinine: 1.7.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `Findings:
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `Chest: Bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, the largest lymph node is
2`74`AC1234 `located in the superior anterior aspect of the left axilla and
2`74`AC1234 `measures 2 x 2 cm. No hilar or mediastinal adenopathy. Small,
2`74`AC1234 `subcentimeter indeterminate pulmonary nodules located in the left
2`74`AC1234 `upper lobe, right middle lobe and bilateral lower lobes (images # 5,
2`74`AC1234 `12, 13 and 16). Small calcified granulomas in the anterolateral
2`74`AC1234 `aspect of the right upper lobe, and right lower lobe. Coronary
2`74`AC1234 `artery calcification.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `Abdomen and pelvis: Multiple, small irregular low-attenuation lesion
2`74`AC1234 `throughout the liver, most of these are subcentimeter in size. The
2`74`AC1234 `largest of these measures 1.2 x 1.2 cm, and is located in the
2`74`AC1234 `posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe. This measures
2`74`AC1234 `approximately +25 Hounsfield units in density and is indeterminate.
2`74`AC1234 `Multiple low-attenuation lesions throughout the spleen, with the
2`74`AC1234 `larger ones measuring approximately 2 cm, and the smaller lesions
2`74`AC1234 `measuring 1 x 1 cm. These appear solid. 3.1 x 2.8 cm well defined,
2`74`AC1234 `fluid attenuation mass arising from the pancreatic head, which has a
2`74`AC1234 `small calcifications in its posterior wall. The remainder of the
2`74`AC1234 `pancreas is normal in appearance with no pancreatic duct dilatation
2`74`AC1234 `or atrophy. No CT evidence for intra or extrahepatic bile duct
2`74`AC1234 `dilatation.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `2 x 2 cm, thick-walled, complex low-attenuation exophytic mass
2`74`AC1234 `arising from the lateral aspect of the lower pole of the left
2`74`AC1234 `kidney. This has a small calcification in its lateral wall. Moderate
2`74`AC1234 `pelvicaliectasis of both kidneys, which is more prominent on the
2`74`AC1234 `right. The ureters are normal in caliber, consistent with a UPJ
2`74`AC1234 `obstruction. Small calcification in the upper pole of the right
2`74`AC1234 `kidney may represent a small calculus. 5 x 4 cm, partially exophytic
2`74`AC1234 `cyst arising from the posterolateral aspect of the interpolar region
2`74`AC1234 `of the left kidney. 2 x 2 cm cyst arising on the lateral aspect of
2`74`AC1234 `the interpolar region of the right kidney.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `Multiple large lymph nodes in the portacaval region, celiac axis
2`74`AC1234 `region, retroperitoneum, throughout the mesentery of the abdomen and
2`74`AC1234 `pelvis, and right inguinal region. The larger nodes measure: In the
2`74`AC1234 `celiac axis region 3 x 2.1 cm, in the anterior aspect of the
2`74`AC1234 `mesentery 3 x 2 cm, and right inguinal region measure 1.2 x 1.2 cm.
2`74`AC1234 `Rounded, soft tissue mass within the posterior aspect of the
2`74`AC1234 `bladder. At the bladder base there are small calcifications adjacent
2`74`AC1234 `to this mass, which may represent bladder calculi.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `Impression:
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `1. Adenopathy in the bilateral axillary regions, celiac axis region,
2`74`AC1234 `portacaval region, retroperitoneum, throughout the mesentery the
2`74`AC1234 `abdomen and pelvis and right inguinal region. These findings are
2`74`AC1234 `most likely due to lymphoma.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `2. Rounded low-attenuation lesions throughout the spleen, which
2`74`AC1234 `appear solid. These are suspicious for lymphomatous involvement of
2`74`AC1234 `the spleen.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `3. Multiple, small, low-attenuation lesions throughout the liver,
2`74`AC1234 `which are too small to characterize.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `4. Large cyst arising from the pancreatic head with a small
2`74`AC1234 `calcifications posterior wall. This may represent a cystic
2`74`AC1234 `pancreatic neoplasm or pancreatic cyst. In the absence of findings
2`74`AC1234 `for acute or chronic pancreatitis, a pseudocyst is less likely.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `5. Complex, exophytic low-attenuation mass arising from the lateral
2`74`AC1234 `aspect of the lower pole of the left kidney. This lesion is
2`74`AC1234 `indeterminate and may represent a solid neoplasm (such as renal cell
2`74`AC1234 `carcinoma or lymphoma) or complicated cyst.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `6. Bilateral pelvicaliectasis with normal caliber bilateral uterus.
2`74`AC1234 `Consistent with a UPJ obstruction, the cause of which is not seen on
2`74`AC1234 `the CT scan.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `7. Small soft tissue mass in the posterior aspect of the bladder
2`74`AC1234 `base, may represent a prominent medial lobe of the  prostate.
2`74`AC1234 `Another diagnostic consideration would include a transitional cell
2`74`AC1234 `carcinoma.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `8. Small calcifications in the bladder base may represent calculi.
2`74`AC1234 `Small calculus in the upper pole of the right kidney.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `9. Small indeterminate pulmonary nodules. Recommend follow up with
2`74`AC1234 `CT for further evaluation. Three small calcified granulomas
2`74`AC1234 `throughout the right lung.
2`74`AC1234 `I have reviewed the film and concur with the above findings.

2`74`AC1234 `multiple foci of abnormal hypermetabolic osseous activity. The nodal
2`74`AC1234 `activity includes cervical, both supraclavicular regions, both
2`74`AC1234 `axilla, right paratracheal region, left hilum, multiple periaortic
2`74`AC1234 `and iliac nodes, severe mesenteric adenopathy, and bilateral
2`74`AC1234 `inguinal adenopathy.  the spleen is diffusely abnormal.   Areas of

2`74`AC1234 `ratio
2`74`AC1234 `is increased (12:1) by manual count, but this may not be accurate due to
2`74`AC1234 `hemodilution. The myeloid and erythroid maturation are both adequate.
2`74`AC1234 `Lymphocytes are not increased comprising 5%. They are morphologically
2`74`AC1234 `normal.
2`74`AC1234 `Megakaryocytes are adequate in morphology.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `The bone marrow touch preparation shows similar findings.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `The iron stain on the aspirate smear shows increased iron.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `Bone marrow core biopsy: The cellularity of the core biopsy is variable,
2`74`AC1234 `ranging from 30 to 80%. Multiple lymphoid aggregates are present
2`74`AC1234 `involving 20%
2`74`AC1234 `of the marrow. The aggregates are represented by mostly paratrabecular
2`74`AC1234 `location. One large aggregate shows expansion into the interstitial
2`74`AC1234 `marrow.
2`74`AC1234 `The aggregates consist of mostly small cells with elongated and cleaved
2`74`AC1234 `nuclei
2`74`AC1234 `intermixed with a few larger transformed cells. The M:E ratio is about
2`74`AC1234 `4:1.
2`74`AC1234 `The myeloid and erythroid maturation are adequate. The megakaryocytes are
2`74`AC1234 `adequate in number and morphology.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `Bone marrow clot sections show similar findings.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `The reticulin stain on the core biopsy shows increased fibrosis
2`74`AC1234 `associated
2`74`AC1234 `with lymphoid aggregates.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL FINDINGS:
2`74`AC1234 `Paraffin immunohistochemistry is performed on core biopsy. CD20 and CD3
2`74`AC1234 `stains
2`74`AC1234 `show a predominance of B cells present in the aggregates.

2`74`AC1234 `DIAGNOSIS:
2`74`AC1234 `A-C. "PERIPHERAL BLOOD AND BONE MARROW" (PERIPHERAL SMEAR, CLOT SECTION,
2`74`AC1234 `CORE
2`74`AC1234 `      BIOPSY, ASPIRATE SMEAR, WITH FLOW CYTOMETRIC IMMUNOPHENOTYPING):
2`74`AC1234 `      BONE MARROW WITH B-CELL LYMPHOMA (20% INVOLVEMENT).  SEE NOTE.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `NOTE: The lymphoma infiltration in the bone marrow is predominantly small
2`74`AC1234 `cell
2`74`AC1234 `component, with no prominent collections of large cells. The lymphoma
2`74`AC1234 `cells
2`74`AC1234 `are not detected by flow cytometry likely due to increased reticulin
2`74`AC1234 `fibrosis
2`74`AC1234 `precluding the aspiration.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `The preliminary findings were discussed with Dr. Moore on 4/3/2001.
2`74`AC1234 ` I certify that I personally conducted the diagnostic evaluation of the
2`74`AC1234 `above
2`74`AC1234 ` specimen(s) and have rendered the above diagnosis(es).

2`74`AC1234 `1. Lymphadenopathy.
2`74`AC1234 `   a. Noted enlarged axillary lymph nodes on routine physical exam,
2`74`AC1234 `      3/15/01.
2`74`AC1234 `   b. Fine needle aspirate of left axillary lymph node.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  I have had a long discussion today with
2`74`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson, his wife, Jane, and his daughter, Betty, both of
2`74`AC1234 `whom accompanied him to the clinic today.  I have gone over at the
2`74`AC1234 `view box all of his CTs and PET scans and have discussed and have
2`74`AC1234 `myself performed a bone marrow as noted above.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `It is my view that he has a malignant lymphoma and that he will
2`74`AC1234 `require treatment for this.  I have gone over the types of lymphoma
2`74`AC1234 `and we have gone over the framework of treatment in that this will
2`74`AC1234 `almost certainly require at least chemotherapy if not chemotherapy
2`74`AC1234 `combined with a targeted anti-CD20 antibody and these plans will be
2`74`AC1234 `solidified when he returns.
2`74`AC1234 ` 
2`74`AC1234 `I have personally spoken with Dr. Doug Tyler today and he will see
2`74`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson in his clinic later on the day of this visit (4/2/01)
2`74`AC1234 `with the plan that a lymph node biopsy for more definitive
2`74`AC1234 `characterization of his lymphoma will be performed on 4/3/01.  When
2`74`AC1234 `these results are complete, we will establish a treatment course.

2`75`AC1234 ` 
2`75`AC1234 ` 
2`75`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson is an 83-year-old Caucasian male newly diagnosed
2`75`AC1234 `large B-cell lymphoma.  He comes to clinic today for beginning of
2`75`AC1234 `his treatment of Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy.
2`75`AC1234 ` 
2`75`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson was seen by Dr. Moore on Friday to give the diagnosis
2`75`AC1234 `of his lymphoma, as well as a treatment plan.  At that time, he was
2`75`AC1234 `noted to be somewhat somnolent, although arousable.  It was noted
2`75`AC1234 `that his calcium was elevated and he was treated with pamidronate.
2`75`AC1234 ` 
2`75`AC1234 `In clinic today, although he is quiet, he much more alert than he
2`75`AC1234 `was in clinic on Friday.  He is accompanied by his wife, Jane, who
2`75`AC1234 `has multiple questions in regard to their treatment planning; mainly
2`75`AC1234 `all dealing around scheduling.
2`75`AC1234 ` 
2`75`AC1234 `Dr. Moore has outlined a treatment plan with Rituxan and CNOP
2`75`AC1234 `chemotherapy to begin today and this would be done every three to
2`75`AC1234 `four weeks for a total of six cycles, but will take a break for
2`75`AC1234 `reevaluation of CT scan after his second or third cycle.
2`75`AC1234 ` 
2`75`AC1234 `He is scheduled to undergo a resting MUGA at the end of this week,
2`75`AC1234 `as well as a brain CT just to rule out any further neurological
2`75`AC1234 `problems.
2`75`AC1234 ` 
2`75`AC1234 `His only complaint today is a decreased appetite, as well as a dry
2`75`AC1234 `hacky cough.  He has also scheduled a root canal on 4/18 and is
2`75`AC1234 `asking whether they should still go ahead with this.
2`75`AC1234 ` 
2`75`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg q.d., multivitamin q.d.,
2`75`AC1234 `vitamin C q.d., vitamin E q.d., sodium chloride oral mouthwash.

2`78`AC1234 `INTERVAL HISTORY:  Dr. Johnson is an 83-year-old Caucasian male
2`78`AC1234 `with a history of large B-cell lymphoma, currently being treated
2`78`AC1234 `with Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy. He comes to clinic today for
2`78`AC1234 `evaluation of his second cycle.
2`78`AC1234 ` 
2`78`AC1234 `He tolerated his first cycle very well, he had no problems with any
2`78`AC1234 `nausea. He only had a few days of fatigue and tiredness. He is
2`78`AC1234 `currently walking 20 minutes every day. He had called the office
2`78`AC1234 `several weeks ago with difficulty with his appetite and was given a
2`78`AC1234 `prescription for Megace and his wife notes a slight improvement with
2`78`AC1234 `this. He has had no problems with constipation or nausea.
2`78`AC1234 ` 
2`78`AC1234 `His main complaint today is of a headache which started last week
2`78`AC1234 `after a root canal. He stated this was sharp in the middle of his
2`78`AC1234 `left side and also has complaints of low back pain. He states that
2`78`AC1234 `he was very active before, playing tennis and had had no previous
2`78`AC1234 `problems with this, and they had called our office yesterday and I
2`78`AC1234 `suggested that he take the one Tylenol No. 3 they had, which he did
2`78`AC1234 `and he noticed immediate relief from this.
2`78`AC1234 ` 
2`78`AC1234 `He comes to clinic today a bit more alert than in previous when his
2`78`AC1234 `calcium was so high and stating that after the pain medicine he has
2`78`AC1234 `been much better with regards to his headache and his back pain.

2`78`AC1234 `acid, we have told him that he can stop his allopurinol.
2`78`AC1234 ` 
2`78`AC1234 `In regards to his back pain, he and his wife were instructed that he
2`78`AC1234 `is allowed to take pain medicine, because she has been afraid to
2`78`AC1234 `give this to him. Due to the Tylenol No. 3 constipating effects, we
2`78`AC1234 `have given him a prescription for Darvocet to take one to two
2`78`AC1234 `tablets four times a day.
2`78`AC1234 ` 
2`78`AC1234 `He was also given a refill on his prescription for his Zofran and
2`78`AC1234 `prednisone to continue on with his chemotherapy. We will also
2`78`AC1234 `continue on his weekly Procrit today and he will received 40,000
2`78`AC1234 `units with his chemotherapy.
2`78`AC1234 `

2`78`AC1234 ` 
2`78`AC1234 `I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and

2`80`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson, his wife and their daughter return to clinic today for a
2`80`AC1234 `follow-up visit.  He was last seen by me on February 12, 2001.  He has a
2`80`AC1234 `diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment as documented previously.
2`80`AC1234 ` 
2`80`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson was recently diagnosed in April 2001 with a large B cell
2`80`AC1234 `lymphoma.  He is being treated and followed by Dr. Joseph Moore and by Dr.
2`80`AC1234 `Fred Cobb.  he started chemotherapy with Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy.
2`80`AC1234 `He started therapy on April 9, 2001.  he is scheduled for additional
2`80`AC1234 `therapy tomorrow and one week from tomorrow.  He had some reduction in his
2`80`AC1234 `appetite after the initiation of therapy.  He has had no difficulties with
2`80`AC1234 `nausea, vomiting.  He has had no bowel or bladder problems.  He reports
2`80`AC1234 `that he is sleeping well at night, sleeping all night long.  He
2`80`AC1234 `occasionally takes a nap.  His wife has been very active in continuing his
2`80`AC1234 `motivation for physical activity.  He goes for supervised workouts twice a
2`80`AC1234 `week.  He is spending more time inside the house.
2`80`AC1234 ` 
2`80`AC1234 `He had a non-contrast CT of the brain performed on April 13, 2001 which
2`80`AC1234 `was negative for any acute intracranial process.
2`80`AC1234 ` 
2`80`AC1234 `The patient will see me in approximately two months for follow up.

2`81`AC1234 ` 
2`81`AC1234 ` 
2`81`AC1234 `INTERVAL HISTORY:  Dr. Johnson is an 83-year-old Caucasian male
2`81`AC1234 `with diagnosis of a large B-cell lymphoma, currently being treated
2`81`AC1234 `with Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy.  He comes to clinic today for
2`81`AC1234 `evaluation of his counts, day eight from his treatment.
2`81`AC1234 ` 
2`81`AC1234 `His major complaint today, and he called Dr. Gockerman over the
2`81`AC1234 `weekend, was a complaint of a headache and dizziness.  Dr. Gockerman
2`81`AC1234 `instructed him to skip his prednisone on Saturday which he did but
2`81`AC1234 `did not notice any change.  He resumed this again on Monday with the
2`81`AC1234 `same symptoms.  He states he feels well in the morning but then
2`81`AC1234 `later on in the afternoon has a headache ranging in the left
2`81`AC1234 `occipital region.  He has taken 1/2 to 1 Darvocet which does help
2`81`AC1234 `relieve the pain but then he feels more confused after taking this.
2`81`AC1234 ` 
2`81`AC1234 `Other than that, he is doing well.  He has had no fevers, no chills,
2`81`AC1234 `no night sweats, nausea or vomiting.
2`81`AC1234 ` 
2`81`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Unchanged from one week ago.

2`82`AC1234 `evaluation of his second cycle.
2`82`AC1234 ` 
2`82`AC1234 `He tolerated his first cycle very well, he had no problems with any
2`82`AC1234 `nausea. He only had a few days of fatigue and tiredness. He is
2`82`AC1234 `currently walking 20 minutes every day. He had called the office
2`82`AC1234 `several weeks ago with difficulty with his appetite and was given a

2`82`AC1234 `this. He has had no problems with constipation or nausea.

2`82`AC1234 `and he noticed immediate relief from this.

2`82`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  Dr. Johnson will go to the treatment room for his
2`82`AC1234 `second cycle of chemotherapy today. Given the decrease in his uric
2`82`AC1234 `acid, we have told him that he can stop his allopurinol.
2`82`AC1234 ` 
2`82`AC1234 `In regards to his back pain, he and his wife were instructed that he
2`82`AC1234 `is allowed to take pain medicine, because she has been afraid to
2`82`AC1234 `give this to him. Due to the Tylenol No. 3 constipating effects, we
2`82`AC1234 `have given him a prescription for Darvocet to take one to two
2`82`AC1234 `tablets four times a day.
2`82`AC1234 ` 
2`82`AC1234 `He was also given a refill on his prescription for his Zofran and
2`82`AC1234 `prednisone to continue on with his chemotherapy. We will also
2`82`AC1234 `continue on his weekly Procrit today and he will received 40,000
2`82`AC1234 `units with his chemotherapy.
2`82`AC1234 ` 
2`82`AC1234 `He will return to clinic in one week just for evaluation of his
2`82`AC1234 `calcium.
2`82`AC1234 ` 
2`82`AC1234 `I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and
2`82`AC1234 `concur with the above findings.

2`84`AC1234 `INTERVAL HISTORY:  Dr. Johnson is an 83-year-old Caucasian male
2`84`AC1234 `with a history of large B-cell lymphoma currently undergoing
2`84`AC1234 `treatment with Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy.  He comes to the
2`84`AC1234 `clinic today for evaluation of his counts.
2`84`AC1234 ` 
2`84`AC1234 `His major complaint today is of weakness and a poor appetite.  He
2`84`AC1234 `had difficulty over the weekend, and both he and his wife stated he
2`84`AC1234 `had difficulty getting up off the couch.  He has noticed a marked

2`84`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  Regarding Dr. Johnson's temperature today in

2`84`AC1234 `temperature, but she will keep checking this daily.  They are
2`84`AC1234 `pleased that he is feeling better this week, and he was encouraged
2`84`AC1234 `to increase his activity, and hopefully this will help with his
2`84`AC1234 `appetite.
2`84`AC1234 ` 
2`84`AC1234 `We gave him a prescription for acyclovir to take for five days to

2`84`AC1234 `by Dr. Moore, and the plan for his chemotherapy on 5/23 as he has a

2`85`AC1234 ` 
2`85`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson returns for a follow-up evaluation, further treatment
2`85`AC1234 `planning and for initiation of his third cycle of CNOP/Ritixmab
2`85`AC1234 `chemotherapy for his malignant lymphoma.
2`85`AC1234 ` 
2`85`AC1234 `He is clearly doing better. He is most bothered by the fact that his
2`85`AC1234 `"head is not ______ , and that he still notes some confusion and
2`85`AC1234 `lack of sharpness mentally." This may not be related to either
2`85`AC1234 `lymphoma or the chemotherapy but certainly is bothersome to him. He
2`85`AC1234 `has marked decrease in energy and has only seen his trainer once in
2`85`AC1234 `the last three weeks. He is fatigued, tired and admittedly
2`85`AC1234 `"depressed" according to his estimation and Jane his wife's.
2`85`AC1234 ` 
2`85`AC1234 `He relates no other new abnormalities. He has no fevers, night
2`85`AC1234 `sweats, nausea, vomiting, purpura, petechia, lymph node enlargement
2`85`AC1234 `and notes that he is really much improved from initiation of
2`85`AC1234 `treatment.

2`85`AC1234 `mild conjunctival subfusion. Tongue is well papalated and benign.
2`85`AC1234 `Lymph nodes:  By careful examination, no lymph nodes are felt in any
2`85`AC1234 `superficial area at this time. Chest:  There are occasional dry
2`85`AC1234 `crackles at the bases but these clear for the most part with cough.
2`85`AC1234 `Heart:  There is a soft systolic murmur at the LOSB. Abdomen:  Soft

2`86`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson returns for a follow-up evaluation, further treatment
2`86`AC1234 `planning and for initiation of his third cycle of CNOP/Ritixmab
2`86`AC1234 `chemotherapy for his malignant lymphoma.
2`86`AC1234 ` 
2`86`AC1234 `He is clearly doing better. He is most bothered by the fact that his
2`86`AC1234 `"head is not right , and that he still notes some confusion and
2`86`AC1234 `lack of sharpness mentally." This may not be related to either
2`86`AC1234 `lymphoma or the chemotherapy but certainly is bothersome to him. He
2`86`AC1234 `has marked decrease in energy and has only seen his trainer once in
2`86`AC1234 `the last three weeks. He is fatigued, tired and admittedly
2`86`AC1234 `"depressed" according to his estimation and Jane his wife's.
2`86`AC1234 ` 
2`86`AC1234 `He relates no other new abnormalities. He has no fevers, night
2`86`AC1234 `sweats, nausea, vomiting, purpura, petechia, lymph node enlargement
2`86`AC1234 `and notes that he is really much improved from initiation of

2`87`AC1234 `83 year old patient with a prominent left axillary lymph node detected on
2`87`AC1234 `physical exam.
2`87`AC1234 ` 
2`87`AC1234 `CLINICAL EXAMINATION:
2`87`AC1234 `FNA x 3 with 23 gauge needle of a 3 x 2 cm left axillary lymph node
2`87`AC1234 `performed
2`87`AC1234 `by Dr. Dodd and Dr. Dash after risks and benefits were explained and
2`87`AC1234 `consent
2`87`AC1234 `issued.
2`87`AC1234 ` 
2`87`AC1234 `MATERIAL SUBMITTED:
2`87`AC1234 `3 prestained smears, 4 prefixed smears, and fluid for flow cytometric
2`87`AC1234 `analysis.
2`87`AC1234 ` 
2`87`AC1234 `DIAGNOSTIC INTERPRETATION:
2`87`AC1234 `Source: Left axillary lymph node - fine needle aspiration.
2`87`AC1234 ` 
2`87`AC1234 `Immediate assessment: Mixed lymphoid population (by Dr. Dodd).
2`87`AC1234 ` 
2`87`AC1234 `Final diagnosis: ATYPICAL/INCONCLUSIVE.
2`87`AC1234 `                 An atypical lymphoid infiltrate is present. See comment.
2`87`AC1234 ` 
2`87`AC1234 `Comment: Flow cytometric analysis (SH-01-7433) reveals a minor monoclonal
2`87`AC1234 `population of B cells in a background of abundant T cells and other
2`87`AC1234 `polyclonal
2`87`AC1234 `B cells. The findings in this case are not diagnostic for lymphoma.  A
2`87`AC1234 `biopsy
2`87`AC1234 `may be helpful and is recommended in this case if clinically indicated.
2`87`AC1234 `Dr.
2`87`AC1234 `Pat Buckley has reviewed this case and concurs.

2`87`AC1234 ` 
2`87`AC1234 `INTERPRETATION: Only a limited panel of the markers is performed due to
2`87`AC1234 `the
2`87`AC1234 `small number of the cells available for evaluation. Identified is a
2`87`AC1234 `phenotypically abnormal population with forward and right-angle scatter
2`87`AC1234 `features of small to medium sized lymphocytes, which constitutes 19% of
2`87`AC1234 `analyzed events. It expresses the B-cell associated antigens CD19, CD20,
2`87`AC1234 `CD22
2`87`AC1234 `and heterogeneous/moderate intensity monoclonal surface immunoglobulin of
2`87`AC1234 `lambda isotype. It is negative for CD10 and CD5.  There appears to be a
2`87`AC1234 `in
2`87`AC1234 `addition to the monoclonal population of lambda positive B-cells. I am
2`87`AC1234 `unable
2`87`AC1234 `to further classify this neoplasm. A biopsy, if clinically indicated, may
2`87`AC1234 `be
2`87`AC1234 `helpful.

2`87`AC1234 `1. Lymphadenopathy.
2`87`AC1234 `   a. Noted enlarged axillary lymph nodes on routine physical exam,
2`87`AC1234 `      3/15/01.
2`87`AC1234 `   b. Fine needle aspirate of left axillary lymph node.
2`87`AC1234 `2. Transient memory loss, MRI 9/99 revealed small vessel ischemic
2`87`AC1234 `   changes.
2`87`AC1234 `3. Lumbar disk disease, status post lumbar disk surgery in 1988.
2`87`AC1234 `4. History of renal calculi, treated with lithotripsy, 9/97.
2`87`AC1234 `5. Renal insufficiency, creatinine since 1995 1.5, now 2.0.
2`87`AC1234 `6. Dupuytren's contractures, status post surgery.
2`87`AC1234 `7. Hyperlipidemia.
2`87`AC1234 `8. In 1994, status post cataract surgery.
2`87`AC1234 ` 
2`87`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:      Dr. Moore examined Mr. Johnson today and noted
2`87`AC1234 `a 2 cm palpable supraclavicular node, as well as a 2 cm inguinal
2`87`AC1234 `lymph node in addition to his axillary lymph node.  In consulting
2`87`AC1234 `with Dr. Johnson, he feels that he has noticed this node in his
2`87`AC1234 `cervical chain for many years without any changes in this.
2`87`AC1234 ` 
2`87`AC1234 `Pathology from his fine needle aspirate is not available at this
2`87`AC1234 `time and preliminary was not able to be diagnosed in clinic.  It is
2`87`AC1234 `a possibility that Dr. Johnson will have to undergo an
2`87`AC1234 `excision of this lymph node for diagnosis.
2`87`AC1234 ` 
2`87`AC1234 `Dr. Moore discussed with Dr. Johnson the fact that he might have
2`87`AC1234 `to undergo a surgical excision of this as we might not have a
2`87`AC1234 `diagnosis.  Discussed with him the possible differential for diagnosis
2`87`AC1234 `including lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease.
2`87`AC1234 ` 
2`87`AC1234 `As Dr. Johnson is going out of town for the next 10 days, we will
2`87`AC1234 `have him return to clinic after this and we will get a chest,
2`87`AC1234 `abdomen and pelvis CT, as well as a PET scan on 3/29.
2`87`AC1234 ` 
2`87`AC1234 `Then he will be seen and evaluated by Dr. Moore on 4/2 when
2`87`AC1234 `hopefully we will have a diagnosis at that time or we will arrange
2`87`AC1234 `for a surgical excision.
2`87`AC1234 ` 
2`87`AC1234 `PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN:  None.

2`89`AC1234 `INTERVAL NOTE
2`89`AC1234 ` 
2`89`AC1234 `INTERVAL HISTORY:  Dr. Johnson is an 83-year-old cacasian male
2`89`AC1234 `with the history of large B-cell lymphoma currently under treatment
2`89`AC1234 `with Rituxan and __________ chemotherapy.  He comes to clinic today
2`89`AC1234 `for evaluation and initiation of cycle four.
2`89`AC1234 ` 
2`89`AC1234 `Since his last clinic visit, he has done relatively well.  He had
2`89`AC1234 `noted increasing fatigue last week when his counts were at their
2`89`AC1234 `lowest, but he is feeling much better over the past few days.  He
2`89`AC1234 `has denied any fevers, chills, or night sweats.  The headaches that
2`89`AC1234 `he has had in the past are better and he is only using an occasional
2`89`AC1234 `Extra Strength Tylenol.  His wife reports that his appetite has been
2`89`AC1234 `relatively poor.  They had stopped the Megace but had not noticed
2`89`AC1234 `any change whether on or off the Megace.
2`89`AC1234 ` 
2`89`AC1234 `They are scheduled to leave for the mountains tomorrow for a couple
2`89`AC1234 `of weeks.
2`89`AC1234 ` 
2`89`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Megace 800 mg q. day not taking, aspirin 81 mg
2`89`AC1234 `q. day, multivitamin q. day, vitamin C 1000 mg q. day, vitamin E 400
2`89`AC1234 `IU q. day, prednisone 100 mg p.o. q. day times five days with

2`91`AC1234 `cycles of chemotherapy.  His counts are quite adequate and he will
2`91`AC1234 `go to the treatment room today for his Rituxan, as well as his
2`91`AC1234 `C-MOPP chemotherapy.  He will also receive his Procrit today.
2`91`AC1234 ` 
2`91`AC1234 `Given the extreme fatigue that he has had each time with each of his
2`91`AC1234 `treatments and the fact that this is quite concerning, we will
2`91`AC1234 `actually start him on Nupogen to take for 5 days, 480 mcg.
2`91`AC1234 `Hopefully, this will help prevent any further fatigue.  He will also
2`91`AC1234 `continue on his Procrit.
2`91`AC1234 ` 
2`91`AC1234 `In regards to his losing weight, I have instructed his wife, Jane,
2`91`AC1234 `to go back on the Megace to see if this will help.
2`91`AC1234 ` 
2`91`AC1234 `He will return to clinic in three weeks for a planned initiation of
2`91`AC1234 `cycle number six of his chemotherapy.
2`91`AC1234 ` 
2`91`AC1234 `I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and
2`91`AC1234 `concur with the above findings.

2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson is an 83-year-old Caucasian male
2`92`AC1234 `with a history of large B cell lymphoma, currently being treated
2`92`AC1234 `with Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy.  He comes to clinic today for
2`92`AC1234 `results of recent scans and to begin his fifth cycle of
2`92`AC1234 `chemotherapy.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `Since last being seen, he and his wife have been out in the
2`92`AC1234 `mountains and he has done relatively well.  Their major complaint
2`92`AC1234 `today is when his counts are low, he is extremely fatigued and he
2`92`AC1234 `can hardly get around. This is typically around his nadir.
2`92`AC1234 `His daughter is with him today and she is quite concerned over this.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `Otherwise, specifically, he has done very well.  He has had no fevers,
2`92`AC1234 `no night sweats, no nausea, vomiting, bleeding, bruising, or lymph
2`92`AC1234 `node enlargement.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `His last Procrit injection was three weks ago.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `His wife, Jane, is also aksing about a physical therapy referral
2`92`AC1234 `to help him regain his strength.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  1. Megace 800 mg q.d., currently not taking.
2`92`AC1234 `2. Baby aspirin 81 mg q.d.  3. Procrit 40,000 units each week.
2`92`AC1234 `4. Multivitamins and vitamin supplements q.d.  5. Prednisone 100 mg
2`92`AC1234 `q.d. for 5 days with chemotherapy.  6. Zofran 8 mg q.8h. p.r.n.

2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `CT chest abdomen pelvis 7/10/01
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `Indication: Lymphoma.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `Comparison: 3/29/01
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `Technique: 5 mm axial images from the lung apices to the pubic
2`92`AC1234 `symphysis were obtained following administration of oral and IV
2`92`AC1234 `contrast, according to standard protocol. 150 cc of Isovue-300 was
2`92`AC1234 `injected without complication.  Recent creatinine was 1.9 on
2`92`AC1234 `7/10/01. The field-of-view was 36 cm.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `Findings:  There is no evidence of pleural effusions.  There has
2`92`AC1234 `been interval left axillary node dissection.  There is interval
2`92`AC1234 `resolution of previously noted bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy,
2`92`AC1234 `with residual post-surgical change in the left axilla.  There is no
2`92`AC1234 `hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  There are stable small
2`92`AC1234 `subcentimeter indeterminate pulmonary nodules located in the left
2`92`AC1234 `upper lobe, right upper lobe just above the minor fissure.  There
2`92`AC1234 `has been interval appearance of a small peripheral nodule in the
2`92`AC1234 `superior segment of the right lower lobe close to the major fissure
2`92`AC1234 `measuring 3-4 mm and indeterminate. Stable small calcified
2`92`AC1234 `granulomas are noted anteriorly in the right lower lobe. Coronary
2`92`AC1234 `artery calcification.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `There are stable multiple small irregular low-attenuation lesion
2`92`AC1234 `scattered throughout the liver, most of which are subcentimeter in
2`92`AC1234 `size. The largest of these is located in the posterior segment of
2`92`AC1234 `the right hepatic lobe and measures 1.1 x 1.2 cm, and approximate 30
2`92`AC1234 `Hounsfield units in density. This lesion is indeterminate but
2`92`AC1234 `stable. There has been interval decrease in size and number of
2`92`AC1234 `multiple low-attenuation lesions noted throughout the spleen,
2`92`AC1234 `compatible with interval improvement in lymphomatous involvement.
2`92`AC1234 `Again identified is a well-defined fluid attenuation mass arising
2`92`AC1234 `from the pancreatic head and peripheral calcification of the
2`92`AC1234 `posterior wall, again measuring 3.1 x 2.8 cm in stable in
2`92`AC1234 `appearance. There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct or
2`92`AC1234 `pancreatic duct dilatation. The remainder of the pancreas is normal
2`92`AC1234 `in appearance.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `Again noted is 2.5 x 2.0 thick wall complex low-attenuation
2`92`AC1234 `exophytic mass arising from lateral aspect of the lower left kidney,
2`92`AC1234 `with calcification in the lateral wall. This was previously stated
2`92`AC1234 `to measure 2 x 2 cm, however the overall appearance and size has not
2`92`AC1234 `changed significantly in the interval. There is moderate stable
2`92`AC1234 `pelvicaliectasis in both kidneys, which is more prominent on the
2`92`AC1234 `right. There is no ureterectasis. There is a stable appearing fluid
2`92`AC1234 `attenuation partially exophytic cyst arising from the
2`92`AC1234 `posterior-lateral aspect of the interpolar region of the left
2`92`AC1234 `kidney. A second stable fluid attenuation 2 x 2 cm cyst arises from
2`92`AC1234 `the lateral aspect of the interpolar region of the right kidney.  A
2`92`AC1234 `third partially exophytic lesion arises more inferiorly in the
2`92`AC1234 `interpolar region of the left kidney, measuring 2 x 2 cm and
2`92`AC1234 `approximately 53 Hounsfield units in density. This much more
2`92`AC1234 `prominent than on the prior exam likely secondary to slice selection.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `There has been dramatic interval improvement in previously noted
2`92`AC1234 `portacaval, celiac axis, retroperitoneal, and mesenteric
2`92`AC1234 `lymphadenopathy, with two residual left periaortic nodes measuring
2`92`AC1234 `1.2 cm and 1.3 cm noted.  The gallbladder is normal.  No free fluid
2`92`AC1234 `is identified within the abdomen or pelvis. The small bowel and
2`92`AC1234 `colon are within normal limits. Multiple bladder calculi are again
2`92`AC1234 `demonstrated. Again noted is well-defined soft tissue density mass
2`92`AC1234 `in the posterior aspect of the bladder contiguous with adjacent
2`92`AC1234 `prostate. Interval resolution of previously noted left inguinal
2`92`AC1234 `lymphadenopathy.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `Impression:
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `1. Interval improvement in adenopathy and lymphomatous involvement
2`92`AC1234 `of the spleen.
2`92`AC1234 `2. Stable large cyst arising from the pancreatic head with small
2`92`AC1234 `calcifications in the posterior wall. This may represent cystic
2`92`AC1234 `pancreatic neoplasm or alternatively a pancreatic cyst.
2`92`AC1234 `3. Multiple stable small low-attenuation indeterminate lesions
2`92`AC1234 `throughout the liver.
2`92`AC1234 `4. Stable complex exophytic low-attenuation mass arising from the
2`92`AC1234 `lateral aspect of the lower pole left kidney. Again, this lesion is
2`92`AC1234 `indeterminate and may represent a solid neoplasm such as a renal
2`92`AC1234 `cell carcinoma, or alternatively complicated cyst.
2`92`AC1234 `5. 2 cm lesion in the posterior aspect of the interpolar region of
2`92`AC1234 `the left kidney, again this may represent a solid neoplasm or a
2`92`AC1234 `hemorrhagic cyst, although interval change in appearance is likely
2`92`AC1234 `secondary to slice selection.
2`92`AC1234 `6. Stable bilateral interpolar cyst.
2`92`AC1234 `7. Bladder calculi.
2`92`AC1234 `8. Stable bilateral pelvicaliectasis without ureterectasis.
2`92`AC1234 `9. Soft tissue mass in the posterior aspect of the bladder which
2`92`AC1234 `likely represents a prominent medial lobe of the prostate.
2`92`AC1234 `Appearance is stable in the interval.
2`92`AC1234 `10. Post-surgical change in the left axilla.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `I have reviewed the film and concur with the above findings.

2`92`AC1234 `Radiopharmaceutical : 10.36 mCi of F-18 FDG, IV.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `Technique : Following radiotracer injection, the patient was allowed
2`92`AC1234 `to rest quietly in a dimly-lit room during uptake phase. Images were

2`92`AC1234 `attenuation correction.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `Findings :
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `There are no definite foci of abnormally increased FDG uptake
2`92`AC1234 `visualized on the current whole body scan. There has been interval
2`92`AC1234 `resolution of the lymph node and the osseous uptake of FDG that was
2`92`AC1234 `visualized on the previous FDG PET scan. There is relatively
2`92`AC1234 `physiologic distribution of FDG throughout the body, with increased
2`92`AC1234 `FDG activity in bilateral strap muscles of the neck.

2`92`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  We are pleased with the results of Dr. Johnson's
2`92`AC1234 `scans, but we do recommend that he continue with the total of six
2`92`AC1234 `cycles of chemotherapy.  His counts are quite adequate and he will

2`92`AC1234 `Hopefully, this will help prevent any further fatigue.  He will also
2`92`AC1234 `continue on his Procrit, unfortunately his travel plans will limit his
2`92`AC1234 `ability to come and receive his Procrit injection here, they are
2`92`AC1234 `going to their place at the beach and then straight to the mountains, we
2`92`AC1234 `will not plan on finding locations for him to receive this as his red
2`92`AC1234 `blood count has been relatively stable off the Procrit for 3 weeks.
2`92`AC1234 ` 
2`92`AC1234 `In regards to his losing weight, I have instructed his wife, Jane,
2`92`AC1234 `to go back on the Megace to see if this will help.
2`92`AC1234 `

2`93`AC1234 `Procedure:  07/31/01             DICT: MARY S. MALICKI, R.N.
2`93`AC1234 `INTERVAL NOTE
2`93`AC1234 ` 
2`93`AC1234 `INTERVAL HISTORY:  Dr. Johnson is an 83-year-old Caucasian male
2`93`AC1234 `with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, currently being
2`93`AC1234 `treated with Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy.  He comes to clinic
2`93`AC1234 `today for evaluation of his sixth cycle of chemotherapy.  He also
2`93`AC1234 `has a history of hypercalcemia and has been treated with pamidronate
2`93`AC1234 `in the past.
2`93`AC1234 ` 
2`93`AC1234 `Since last being seen, Dr. Johnson had done relatively well until
2`93`AC1234 `approximately 10 days ago, when he presented to the Duke ER with
2`93`AC1234 `increased confusion.  He had been doing well, was at the beach and
2`93`AC1234 `had tolerated his Neupogen injections, but had noticed an onset over
2`93`AC1234 `the day of more confusion so his family brought him to the ER.  A
2`93`AC1234 `full exam was done, as well as lab work, which did not reveal any
2`93`AC1234 `hypercalcemia at that time.  He was discharged and the family has
2`93`AC1234 `kept an eye on this and this has not returned.  He still has his
2`93`AC1234 `normal baseline mental function.
2`93`AC1234 ` 
2`93`AC1234 `He is working with a physical therapist three times a week and his
2`93`AC1234 `wife feels this is helping him but he is complaining about not
2`93`AC1234 `having any energy or strength to continue.  He is sleeping better
2`93`AC1234 `and is eating better and has actually gained weight since his last
2`93`AC1234 `clinic visit where he had restarted the Megace.
2`93`AC1234 ` 
2`93`AC1234 `Due to extreme fatigue at the last clinic visit, we had initiated
2`93`AC1234 `Neupogen to hopefully help with this and he was to continue on the
2`93`AC1234 `Procrit.  Unfortunately, he did get the Neupogen, but did not get
2`93`AC1234 `the Procrit.  The last Procrit shot was three weeks ago.
2`93`AC1234 ` 
2`93`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Megace 800 mg q.d.  Baby aspirin 81 mg q.d.
2`93`AC1234 `Procrit 40,000 units subcu each week.  Multivitamin q.d.  Prednisone
2`93`AC1234 `100 mg q.d. for five days with chemotherapy.  Zofran 8 mg q.8.h.
2`93`AC1234 `p.r.n., currently not taking.  Neupogen 480 mcg q.d. x five days

2`93`AC1234 `   __ Status post six cycles of Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy,

2`93`AC1234 `2.
2`93`AC1234 `   b. Pamidronate given 7/31/01.
2`93`AC1234 ` 
2`93`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  In regards to his chemotherapy, his counts were good
2`93`AC1234 `enough for his last dose of Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy today.  I
2`93`AC1234 `have reviewed again with Jane, his wife, the Neupogen and have
2`93`AC1234 `written down the instructions:  He is to take 480 mcg subcu q.d. for
2`93`AC1234 `five days and again Procrit once a week on Tuesdays,
2`93`AC1234 `40,000 units, and was given a prescription for both, as they are
2`93`AC1234 `going to the mountains.  In regards to his slightly elevated calcium
2`93`AC1234 `level from previous, we have decided to give him another round of
2`93`AC1234 `pamidronate due to this, as well as increasing confusion.  He will
2`93`AC1234 `also be transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells to
2`93`AC1234 `hopefully help with his fatigue.  They are scheduled to leave on
2`93`AC1234 `Thursday, August 2, for the mountains for one month.  We will have
2`93`AC1234 `him return to clinic on September 6, with evaluation of his counts
2`93`AC1234 `only.  Further treatment planning will be done at that time and we
2`93`AC1234 `will decide when to rescan him and evaluate his calcium level.
2`93`AC1234 ` 
2`93`AC1234 ` 
2`93`AC1234 `I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and
2`93`AC1234 `concur with the above findings.

2`94`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  In regards to his chemotherapy, his counts were good
2`94`AC1234 `enough for his last dose of Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy today.  I
2`94`AC1234 `have reviewed again with Jane, his wife, the Neupogen and have
2`94`AC1234 `written down the instructions:  He is to take 480 mcg subcu q.d. for
2`94`AC1234 `five days and again Procrit once a week on Tuesdays,
2`94`AC1234 `40,000 units, and was given a prescription for both, as they are
2`94`AC1234 `going to the mountains.
2`94`AC1234 ` 
2`94`AC1234 `In regards to his slightly elevated calcium level from previous, we have
2`94`AC1234 `decided
2`94`AC1234 `to give him another round of pamidronate due to this, as well as
2`94`AC1234 `increasing
2`94`AC1234 `confusion.  He will also be transfused with 2 units of packed red blood
2`94`AC1234 `cells to
2`94`AC1234 `hopefully help with his fatigue.  They are scheduled to leave on
2`94`AC1234 `Thursday, August 2, for the mountains for one month.  We will have
2`94`AC1234 `him return to clinic on September 6, with evaluation of his counts
2`94`AC1234 `only.  Further treatment planning will be done at that time and we
2`94`AC1234 `will decide when to rescan him and evaluate his calcium level.
2`94`AC1234 ` 
2`94`AC1234 `I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and
2`94`AC1234 `concur with the above findings.

2`97`AC1234 `Procedure:  09/04/01             DICT: MARY S. MALICKI, R.N.
2`97`AC1234 `INTERVAL HISTORY:  Dr. Johnson is an 83-year-old Caucasian
2`97`AC1234 `gentleman with a history of diffuse large B cell lymphoma status
2`97`AC1234 `post six cycles of Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy completed 7/30/01.
2`97`AC1234 `He also has a history of hypercalcemia and has received two
2`97`AC1234 `pamidrinate doses, the last one 7/31.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `Since last being seen in the clinic, his wife Jane and he had
2`97`AC1234 `travelled to their mountain home.  During that time, he was
2`97`AC1234 `undergoing physical therapy to help regain his strength.  He woke up
2`97`AC1234 `complaining of a swollen left calf and noted some swelling.  He was
2`97`AC1234 `seen and evaluated by the local hospital and admitted for a DVT.  He
2`97`AC1234 `was initially admitted with heparin and has now been converted to
2`97`AC1234 `Coumadin.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `Otherwise, he has done well.  He has a good appetite and has
2`97`AC1234 `actually gained some weight.  His leg is still bothering him mildly,
2`97`AC1234 `but not near what it was and he states that the swelling has gone
2`97`AC1234 `down.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `His wife comes today with several concerns.  He has needed lots of
2`97`AC1234 `dental work, a couple of crowns and has been putting this off since
2`97`AC1234 `on the chemotherapy and are wondering if they should continue on
2`97`AC1234 `with this now.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `He has had no fevers, no chills, no nightsweats, no dizziness.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `His wife is also asking should he be on physical therapy here and
2`97`AC1234 `how active should he be with his walking and training.  He had been
2`97`AC1234 `receiving Procrit 40,000 units on Tuesdays each week while in the
2`97`AC1234 `mountains.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin 2.5 mg q.d.  Celexa 20 q.d.  Procrit
2`97`AC1234 `40,000 units subcu q Tuesdays.
2`97`AC1234 `

2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `GENERAL:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished elderly appearing
2`97`AC1234 `Caucasian gentleman in no acute distress.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `HEENT:  Oral cavity without lesions.  Nasal mucosa clear.  External
2`97`AC1234 `auditory canals clear with tympanic membranes intact.  No alopecia.
2`97`AC1234 `Sclerae anicteric.  NECK:  Trachea midline, thyroid normal.  NODES:
2`97`AC1234 `No superficial palpable lymph nodes. CHEST:  Clear to auscultation
2`97`AC1234 `and percussion.  CARDIAC:  1/6 systolic ejection murmur.  BREASTS:
2`97`AC1234 `Without masses, tenderness, or discharge.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and
2`97`AC1234 `nontender.  No organomegaly or masses palpable.  Bowel sounds

2`97`AC1234 `LABORATORY DATA:  (Import)
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `IMAGING STUDIES:  None.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `PROCEDURES:  None.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `IMPRESSION:  (Import)
2`97`AC1234 `1. History of deep venous thrombosis.
2`97`AC1234 `   a. Coumadin therapy ongoing.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  Dr. Moore reviewed with Dr. and Mrs. Johnson the
2`97`AC1234 `fact that given his DVT, he would need to remain on the Coumadin for
2`97`AC1234 `at least three to four months.  At that time, we would reevaluate
2`97`AC1234 `him and consider taking him off.  Given his coagulation studies
2`97`AC1234 `today, we have elected to increase his Coumadin to alternating 2.5
2`97`AC1234 `with 5 mg every other day.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `In regards to his dental work, we are recommending he not have this
2`97`AC1234 `done at this time.  We will wait a month until we have his Coumadin
2`97`AC1234 `more stable and his DVT is not as fresh when we will be able to take
2`97`AC1234 `him off for a period of time.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `In regards to his lymphoma, he had had a great response to his
2`97`AC1234 `chemotherapy, but we will rescan him within the next month just for
2`97`AC1234 `routine followup.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `They will return to the clinic on Friday for evaluation of his
2`97`AC1234 `coagulations and plan on adjusting his Coumadin as needed.
2`97`AC1234 ` 
2`97`AC1234 `I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and
2`97`AC1234 `concur with the above findings.

2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `INTERVAL HISTORY:  Dr. Johnson is an 83-year-old Caucasian
2`99`AC1234 `gentleman with a history of diffuse large B cell lymphoma status
2`99`AC1234 `post six cycles of Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy completed 7/30/01.
2`99`AC1234 `He also has a history of hypercalcemia and has received two
2`99`AC1234 `pamidrinate doses, the last one 7/31.
2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `Since last being seen in the clinic, his wife Jane and he had
2`99`AC1234 `travelled to their mountain home.  During that time, he was
2`99`AC1234 `undergoing physical therapy to help regain his strength.  He woke up
2`99`AC1234 `complaining of a swollen left calf and noted some swelling.  He was
2`99`AC1234 `seen and evaluated by the local hospital and admitted for a DVT.  He
2`99`AC1234 `was initially admitted with heparin and has now been converted to
2`99`AC1234 `Coumadin.  He was discharged from the hospital 2 days ago.  On returning
2`99`AC1234 `home, they had lost their prescription for Coumadin and called Dr.
2`99`AC1234 `Gockerman, the on call physician, who gave the a scrip for 5 mg as
2`99`AC1234 `they could not remember the dose he was taking.  They come today for
2`99`AC1234 `follow up and checking his protime and to adjusy his coumadin as
2`99`AC1234 `required.  He had a routing followup appointment for later this week.
2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `Otherwise, he has done well.  He has a good appetite and has
2`99`AC1234 `actually gained some weight.  His leg is still bothering him mildly,
2`99`AC1234 `but not near what it was and he states that the swelling has gone
2`99`AC1234 `down.
2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `His wife comes today with several concerns.  He has needed lots of
2`99`AC1234 `dental work, a couple of crowns and has been putting this off since
2`99`AC1234 `on the chemotherapy and are wondering if they should continue on
2`99`AC1234 `with this now.
2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `She is also concerned about his confusion.  He has been seen and
2`99`AC1234 `evaluated by the memory disorder clinic here at Duke and is though
2`99`AC1234 `to have early dementia.  But I should note that they have travelled
2`99`AC1234 `significantly during his chemotherapy to the mountains and to the
2`99`AC1234 `beach.
2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `He has had no fevers, no chills, no nightsweats, no dizziness.
2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `His wife is also asking should he be on physical therapy here and
2`99`AC1234 `how active should he be with his walking and training.  He had been
2`99`AC1234 `receiving Procrit 40,000 units on Tuesdays each week while in the
2`99`AC1234 `mountains.
2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin 2.5 mg q.d.  Celexa 20 q.d.  Procrit
2`99`AC1234 `40,000 units subcu q Tuesdays, Megace, not currently taking.

2`99`AC1234 `10.History of deep venous thrombosis 8/01.
2`99`AC1234 `   a. Coumadin therapy, ongoing.
2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  Dr. Moore reviewed with Dr. and Mrs. Johnson the
2`99`AC1234 `fact that given his DVT, he would need to remain on the Coumadin for
2`99`AC1234 `at least three to four months.  At that time, we would reevaluate
2`99`AC1234 `him and consider taking him off.  Given his coagulation studies
2`99`AC1234 `today, we have elected to increase his Coumadin to alternating 2.5
2`99`AC1234 `with 5 mg every other day.
2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `In regards to his dental work, we are recommending he not have this
2`99`AC1234 `done at this time.  We will wait a month until we have his Coumadin
2`99`AC1234 `more stable and his DVT is not as fresh when we will be able to take
2`99`AC1234 `him off for a period of time.
2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `In regards to his lymphoma, he had had a great response to his
2`99`AC1234 `chemotherapy, but we will rescan him within the next month just for
2`99`AC1234 `routine followup.
2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `They will return to the clinic on Friday for evaluation of his
2`99`AC1234 `coagulations and plan on adjusting his Coumadin as needed.
2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `I discussed with Jane, his wife and Betty, his daughter that all the
2`99`AC1234 `travelling he has been doing lately contributes to his confusion
2`99`AC1234 `and it would be a good idea for a period of time to stay in town
2`99`AC1234 `and develop a routine.
2`99`AC1234 ` 
2`99`AC1234 `I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and
2`99`AC1234 `concur with the above findings.

2`100`AC1234 `  CT scan, 9/18/01, no evidence of lymphoma, still persistent renal
2`100`AC1234 `  cyst.
2`100`AC1234 ` 
2`100`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  Dr. Moore reviewed with Dr. and Mrs. Johnson and
2`100`AC1234 `their daughter, Betty, the results of his CT scan were remarkable
2`100`AC1234 `given his lymphoma.
2`100`AC1234 ` 
2`100`AC1234 `We did discuss the fact that there has been another clot develop in
2`100`AC1234 `his left femoral area, but this has probably been there and is not a
2`100`AC1234 `concern as he is on an anticoagulant.
2`100`AC1234 ` 
2`100`AC1234 `We will contact Dr. Cary Robertson to reevaluate him as he has
2`100`AC1234 `persistent areas in his kidneys, most likely cysts, but to have him
2`100`AC1234 `reevaluated.
2`100`AC1234 ` 
2`100`AC1234 `In regards to his lymphoma, we will repeat his CT scans in three
2`100`AC1234 `months.
2`100`AC1234 ` 
2`100`AC1234 `I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and
2`100`AC1234 `concur with the above findings.

2`102`AC1234 `CT PELVIS W/ENHANCE
2`102`AC1234 ` 
2`102`AC1234 `Study: CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed 9/17/01.
2`102`AC1234 ` 
2`102`AC1234 `Comparison: 7/10/01
2`102`AC1234 ` 
2`102`AC1234 `Indications: 83 year-old male follow-up lymphoma.
2`102`AC1234 ` 
2`102`AC1234 `Technique: Multiple contiguous axial images were obtained in the
2`102`AC1234 `level of the diaphragm to the pubic symphysis after the
2`102`AC1234 `administration of oral and IV contrast. 150 cc Isovue was injected
2`102`AC1234 `at a rate of 3 cc/sec. FOV is 38 cm.
2`102`AC1234 ` 
2`102`AC1234 `Findings: Patchy atelectasis is noted on the bases. No significant
2`102`AC1234 `mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph nodes are identified. No
2`102`AC1234 `parenchymal nodules are seen.
2`102`AC1234 ` 
2`102`AC1234 `There are multiple low-attenuation lesions scattered throughout the
2`102`AC1234 `liver, most measuring less than 1 cm. The largest of these lesions
2`102`AC1234 `measures approximately 1 cm in size. These are unchanged in
2`102`AC1234 `appearance and likely represent cysts. No new enhancing lesions are
2`102`AC1234 `identified. The spleen, adrenals, and  gallbladder are unremarkable.
2`102`AC1234 `Again noted is a well-defined fluid attenuation mass arising from
2`102`AC1234 `the pancreatic head with peripheral calcifications. This is
2`102`AC1234 `unchanged in appearance from the prior study. No hepatic or
2`102`AC1234 `pancreatic ductal dilatation is identified. The remainder of the
2`102`AC1234 `pancreas is normal. Again noted is 2.5 x 2 cm thick-walled complex
2`102`AC1234 `low-attenuation exophytic mass off the lateral posterior aspect of
2`102`AC1234 `the left kidney with calcifications in the wall. This is unchanged
2`102`AC1234 `in appearance. There is moderate stable pelviectasis in the both
2`102`AC1234 `kidneys. No ureterectasis is identified. There is a 2 x 2 cm lesion
2`102`AC1234 `again noted in the interpolar region of the left kidney which is
2`102`AC1234 `unchanged appearance. This is of higher attenuation than the
2`102`AC1234 `surrounding cysts and is again unchanged from the prior study.   A
2`102`AC1234 `smaller exophytic higher attenuation renal mass is noted within the
2`102`AC1234 `lower pole of the left kidney which measures approximately 1.2 cm
2`102`AC1234 `and is unchanged in appearance. Several simple cysts are noted
2`102`AC1234 `involving the right kidney.
2`102`AC1234 `

2`102`AC1234 `of the celiac axis also seen on the prior study and is unchanged in
2`102`AC1234 `appearance. This likely represents a lymph node. Small mesenteric
2`102`AC1234 `lymph nodes are identified. Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are
2`102`AC1234 `also seen, unchanged from the prior study. No new large adenopathy

2`102`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  Dr. Moore reviewed with Dr. and Mrs. Johnson and
2`102`AC1234 `their daughter, Betty, the results of his CT scan were remarkable
2`102`AC1234 `given his lymphoma.
2`102`AC1234 ` 
2`102`AC1234 `We did discuss the fact that there has been another clot develop in
2`102`AC1234 `his left femoral area, but this has probably been there and is not a
2`102`AC1234 `concern as he is on an anticoagulant. He will return in one week
2`102`AC1234 `to have his PT checked.
2`102`AC1234 ` 
2`102`AC1234 `We will contact Dr. Cary Robertson to reevaluate him as he has
2`102`AC1234 `persistent areas in his kidneys, most likely cysts, but to have him
2`102`AC1234 `reevaluated.
2`102`AC1234 ` 
2`102`AC1234 `In regards to his lymphoma, we will repeat his CT scans in three
2`102`AC1234 `months.
2`102`AC1234 ` 
2`102`AC1234 `I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and
2`102`AC1234 `concur with the above findings.

2`104`AC1234 `HISTORY:  The patient comes in with an ingrown left great toenail.
2`104`AC1234 `He is having continuous discomfort in the area.  It has been worse

2`106`AC1234 ` 
2`106`AC1234 `INDICATIONS:  Dr. Johnson is an 83-year-old gentleman with a
2`106`AC1234 `history of non-Hodgkins lymphoma and history of DVT, taking
2`106`AC1234 `Coumadin.  The patient has had a left first toe ingrown toenail for
2`106`AC1234 `several years and it has been causing him great discomfort and pain.
2`106`AC1234 `The patient presents for surgical removal of his first toe toenail.
2`106`AC1234 ` 
2`106`AC1234 `DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was placed in supine
2`106`AC1234 `position.  MAC was given for sedation and the left foot was prepped
2`106`AC1234 `and draped in standard surgical fashion.  Local lidocaine 1% without
2`106`AC1234 `epinephrine was administered for a first toe block, as well as local
2`106`AC1234 `anesthesia given around the base of the first toe.  Estimated 7 cc
2`106`AC1234 `of lidocaine was administered.  The first toenail was then bluntly
2`106`AC1234 `dissected off the toenail bed with hemostats and then removed by
2`106`AC1234 `forcibly extracting the nail from its nail bed.  The base of the
2`106`AC1234 `nail bed was then cauterized and the rest of the nail bed was
2`106`AC1234 `coagulated to stop any bleeding.  The toe was then packed with
2`106`AC1234 `Iodoform packing and then dressed with dry one inch gauze roll.  The
2`106`AC1234 `sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct at the end of the
2`106`AC1234 `case.  Dr. Moylan was in the OR and scrubbed at all times during the
2`106`AC1234 `case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported
2`106`AC1234 `to the recovery room awake and alert in good condition.
2`106`AC1234 ` 
2`106`AC1234 `COMPLICATIONS:  None.

2`108`AC1234 `HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
2`108`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson, his wife and their daughter return to clinic today for a
2`108`AC1234 `follow-up visit.  He was last seen by me on April 23, 2001.  He has a
2`108`AC1234 `diagnosis of cognitive impairment.  He also has a diagnosis of diffuse
2`108`AC1234 `large B-cell lymphoma.  Dr. Johnson has just completed a course of 6
2`108`AC1234 `cycles of Rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy with his last dose being received
2`108`AC1234 `on July 31, 2001.  He continues to have follow-up care by Dr. Joseph O.
2`108`AC1234 `Moore.  He was last seen by Dr. Moore on September 18, 2001.  Since the
2`108`AC1234 `patient was last seen by me in the Memory Disorders Clinic on April 23,
2`108`AC1234 `2001, Dr. Johnson has finished his chemotherapy.  He had a deep vein
2`108`AC1234 `thrombosis of his left calf and is presently on Coumadin 2.5 mg
2`108`AC1234 `alternating with 5 mg every other day.  He is also on Celexa 20 mg a day,
2`108`AC1234 `Multivitamins and Vitamin E.
2`108`AC1234 ` 
2`108`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson was initially seen by me on March 8, 2000 for evaluation
2`108`AC1234 `of memory difficulties.  The complete history, physical examination,
2`108`AC1234 `laboratory and imaging studies are summarized in my previous notes.  Since
2`108`AC1234 `the last clinic visit on April 23, 2001, Dr. Johnson has had decline of
2`108`AC1234 `memory.  He states that he has had increasing difficulties with memory
2`108`AC1234 `particularly short term memory.  He states that he has had problems with
2`108`AC1234 `mood depression and admits to feeling moderately depressed.  He denies any
2`108`AC1234 `problems with crying.  He states that his sleep is fine and he has no
2`108`AC1234 `trouble with early a.m. awakening.  He denies any difficulties with
2`108`AC1234 `lateralized motor or sensory disturbance.  He states that he has mild
2`108`AC1234 `intermittent bifrontal headache, but has had this problem for years and it
2`108`AC1234 `has not changed quantitatively or qualitatively.  He is spending much of
2`108`AC1234 `his time inside of the house.  He is presently walking with a cane,
2`108`AC1234 `because of his deep vein thrombosis and leg pain.  He had a non-contrast
2`108`AC1234 `CT scan of the brain performed on April 13, which revealed no evidence of
2`108`AC1234 `acute intracranial processes.
2`108`AC1234 ` 
2`108`AC1234 `PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
2`108`AC1234 `BP 159/91, pulse 77, weight 174 lb.
2`108`AC1234 ` 
2`108`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson is alert and cooperative.  Extraocular movements are full
2`108`AC1234 `and conjugate with no evidence of nystagmus.  Upgaze and downgaze are
2`108`AC1234 `normal.  Pupils are 5 mm and react equally to light.  Funduscopic
2`108`AC1234 `examination reveals sharp discs bilaterally.  The corneal reflex is brisk
2`108`AC1234 `bilaterally.  Face is symmetric and facial sensation is normal to light
2`108`AC1234 `touch.  Tongue and uvula are midline and there is no dysarthria.
2`108`AC1234 ` 
2`108`AC1234 `On motor examination there is no evidence of drift or adventitious
2`108`AC1234 `movements of the outstretched arms.  Gait is halting, but symmetric and he
2`108`AC1234 `is using a cane in his left hand.
2`108`AC1234 `DTR's are diminished, but symmetric with 1+ biceps, triceps,
2`108`AC1234 `brachioradialis, trace knee jerks, 1+ ankle jerks bilaterally.  The toes
2`108`AC1234 `are downgoing with plantar stimulation.  Light touch is normal on the
2`108`AC1234 `face, arms.  Light touch is diminished in the lower extremities.  Position
2`108`AC1234 `sense is normal in the fingers and is diminished in the toes.  Rapid
2`108`AC1234 `finger movements reveal mild apraxia bilaterally.  Finger to nose testing
2`108`AC1234 `is normal.
2`108`AC1234 ` 
2`108`AC1234 `On MMSE the patient scored 18.
2`108`AC1234 ` 
2`108`AC1234 `ASSESSMENT
2`108`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson has evidence of progressive memory dysfunction as
2`108`AC1234 `documented today compared to his previous studies.  He also has evidence
2`108`AC1234 `of a sensory polyneuropathy most likely due to chemotherapy.
2`108`AC1234 ` 
2`108`AC1234 `Today I am ordering an MRI scan of the brain with and without
2`108`AC1234 `enhancement.  The patient will see me in return appointment in
2`108`AC1234 `approximately 4 weeks.

2`109`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson returns to clinic having had a toenail excised.  The
2`109`AC1234 `wound is raw but no sign of significant infection.  His leg is
2`109`AC1234 `swollen from his phlebitis.
2`109`AC1234 ` 
2`109`AC1234 `He is advised to wash the toenail area twice a day, keep it dressed
2`109`AC1234 `and to resume his antiphlebitis stockings as well as to contact Dr.
2`109`AC1234 `Joe Moore to increase his diuresis as he looks slightly edematous.

2`110`AC1234 ` 
2`110`AC1234 ` 
2`110`AC1234 ` 
2`110`AC1234 `Subjective:  Dr. Johnson was seen in clinic today, along with his
2`110`AC1234 `wife, who has a scheduled appointment.  Dr. Johnson is having some
2`110`AC1234 `difficulty with his left leg and foot.  In August of this year, while
2`110`AC1234 `vacationing in the mountains of North Carolina, he developed asymmetric
2`110`AC1234 `swelling in the left lower extremity.  He was diagnosed as having
2`110`AC1234 `thrombophlebitis in that extremity by ultrasound.  He was begun on
2`110`AC1234 `Coumadin and placed in Ted's stockings.  Approximately one week ago, he
2`110`AC1234 `noted increasing pain in his left great toe and underwent nail avulsion
2`110`AC1234 `for correction of an ingrown nail.
2`110`AC1234 ` 
2`110`AC1234 `He has had persistent lower extremity edema, for which he received
2`110`AC1234 `Maxzide and subsequently begun on Demodex.  He has become slightly
2`110`AC1234 `orthostatic but his leg edema remains.
2`110`AC1234 ` 
2`110`AC1234 `Physical Examination:      On exam today his edema is asymmetric.  There
2`110`AC1234 `is no edema in the right ankle and calf but the left ankle and calf are
2`110`AC1234 `several centimeters greater in diameter and exquisitely tender to
2`110`AC1234 `palpation.  Peripheral pulses in both extremities are easily palpable.
2`110`AC1234 `The left great toe is markedly erythematous.
2`110`AC1234 ` 
2`110`AC1234 `Impression and Plan:  I think Dr. Johnson's edema is likely related to
2`110`AC1234 `a post phlebitic syndrome rather than extracellular fluid excess.  That
2`110`AC1234 `being the case, we should be able to clear his leg edema with a
2`110`AC1234 `compression bandage over the weekend and put him in a compression stocking
2`110`AC1234 `that would provide 30-40 mm compression at the ankle.  I have asked him to
2`110`AC1234 `hold off taking Demodex and we will see if we can taper the Maxzide after
2`110`AC1234 `we eliminate his edema with compression bandaging.
2`110`AC1234 ` 
2`110`AC1234 `Finally, Mrs. Johnson is concerned about the increased erythema that
2`110`AC1234 `has developed over the last 24-48 hours associated with increased warmth
2`110`AC1234 `around the toe.  It is possible that there might be a little cellulitis
2`110`AC1234 `following his recent surgery.  We will give him a course of Keflex 5 mg po
2`110`AC1234 `TID.  I will see him in follow up Monday afternoon and remove his
2`110`AC1234 `compression bandage.  If his edema and tenderness has resolved, we will
2`110`AC1234 `transition him to a compression stocking that will provide 30-40 at the
2`110`AC1234 `ankle.  If he has any problems or difficulties over the weekend he will
2`110`AC1234 `contact us.

2`111`AC1234 `HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
2`111`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson, his wife and their daughter return to clinic today for a
2`111`AC1234 `follow-up visit.  He was last seen by me on October 8, 2001.  He has a
2`111`AC1234 `diagnosis of cognitive impairment and also has a diagnosis of large B-cell
2`111`AC1234 `lymphoma being actively followed and treated by Dr. Joseph Moore.
2`111`AC1234 ` 
2`111`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson was evaluated by Dr. Joseph Moore on September 18, 2001.
2`111`AC1234 `At that visit he had a CT scan which revealed no evidence of lymphoma, but
2`111`AC1234 `persistent renal cyst.  Dr. Johnson is scheduled to return for follow
2`111`AC1234 `up with Dr. Moore in December.  He had extensive laboratory studies
2`111`AC1234 `performed at that visit.
2`111`AC1234 ` 
2`111`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson is presently on Coumadin 2.5 mg alternating with 5 mg
2`111`AC1234 `every other day, Celexa 20 mg a day, Multivitamins and Vitamin E.
2`111`AC1234 ` 
2`111`AC1234 `Since the last clinic visit Dr. Johnson has remained physically
2`111`AC1234 `active.  He gets walking exercises every day.  He has a trainer come twice
2`111`AC1234 `a week.  He is staying active mentally by reading books.  It is clear that
2`111`AC1234 `he is having significant problems with his memory and often turns to his
2`111`AC1234 `wife for information.
2`111`AC1234 ` 
2`111`AC1234 `Since the last neurological evaluation Dr. Johnson has had some
2`111`AC1234 `problems with mild intermittent bifrontal headache which usually lasts
2`111`AC1234 `less than a half hour and is unassociated with other neurologic
2`111`AC1234 `symptomatology.  He states that he has had headaches like these
2`111`AC1234 `previously.  He is presently sleeping well.  His appetite is good.  He
2`111`AC1234 `recently had a 3-day visit to Myrtle Beach to visit with friends.
2`111`AC1234 ` 
2`111`AC1234 `Because of the problems with headaches, we at the last visit ordered an
2`111`AC1234 `MRI scan with and without enhancement which was performed on November 1,
2`111`AC1234 `2001.  The MRI scan demonstrated diffuse volume loss and microangiopathic
2`111`AC1234 `changes.  He had some inflammatory changes in the right mastoid air cells.
2`111`AC1234 ` There was no evidence of midline shift or mass effect, extra-axial fluid
2`111`AC1234 `or intra-axial fluid.
2`111`AC1234 ` 
2`111`AC1234 `PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
2`111`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson is alert and cooperative.  Extraocular movements are full
2`111`AC1234 `and conjugate.  Pupils are 4 mm and reactive to light.  Funduscopic
2`111`AC1234 `examination reveals sharp discs bilaterally.
2`111`AC1234 ` 
2`111`AC1234 `Motor examination reveals no evidence of drift or adventitious movements
2`111`AC1234 `of the outstretched arms.
2`111`AC1234 ` 
2`111`AC1234 `DTR's are symmetric with 2+ biceps, triceps, brachioradialis and knee
2`111`AC1234 `jerks.  Ankle jerk on the right is 1+, untestable on the left because of a
2`111`AC1234 `bandage.
2`111`AC1234 ` 
2`111`AC1234 `ASSESSMENT
2`111`AC1234 `From a neurologic standpoint Dr. Johnson appears stable.  He has
2`111`AC1234 `evidence of cognitive and memory disturbances outlined previously.  There
2`111`AC1234 `is no evidence of lateralized disturbance on this examination.
2`111`AC1234 ` 
2`111`AC1234 `The patient will return to clinic to see me in approximately six months.

2`113`AC1234 ` 
2`113`AC1234 `SUBJECTIVE:
2`113`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson returns for general medical follow-up and because of
2`113`AC1234 `dizziness recently.  He has had a difficult time since I saw him last
2`113`AC1234 `formally in 9/00.  On a routine exam with Dr. Cobb in 3/01 he was found to
2`113`AC1234 `have left axillary lymphadenopathy, underwent a series of studies leading
2`113`AC1234 `to diagnosis of lymphoma.  He has been treated and followed by Dr. Joe
2`113`AC1234 `Moore and is undergoing chemotherapy which he completed this summer.  He
2`113`AC1234 `was placed on Celexa for some depression symptoms.  He continues to see
2`113`AC1234 `Dr. Strittmatter for neurologic and memory issues.  A recent MRI was
2`113`AC1234 `performed with results as noted.  In addition he has been on Coumadin
2`113`AC1234 `since late August when he developed a left lower extremity DVT.  He uses
2`113`AC1234 `compression stocking on that leg currently and is monitored through the
2`113`AC1234 `Coumadin clinic.  He did report to Dr. Strittmatter that he was having
2`113`AC1234 `daily headaches and underwent an MRI in late October as noted.  Since he
2`113`AC1234 `saw Dr. Strittmatter three weeks or so ago he noted the onset of some
2`113`AC1234 `orthostatic dizziness lasting up to 1-2 minutes, when changing positions
2`113`AC1234 `from lying to sitting or sitting to standing.  He has not fallen.  His
2`113`AC1234 `wife accompanies him today.  He has had a slight cough for the past week,
2`113`AC1234 `took some Robitussin, has had no fevers or chills.
2`113`AC1234 ` 
2`113`AC1234 `Medications:  Celexa 20 mg qd, Vitamin E, Coumadin 7.5 alternating with 5
2`113`AC1234 `mg per day.
2`113`AC1234 ` 
2`113`AC1234 `OBJECTIVE:
2`113`AC1234 `Quiet, very pleasant gentleman in no acute distress.  He would turn to
2`113`AC1234 `his wife occasionally for help with answers to questions.  Blood pressure
2`113`AC1234 `116/76 lying, 112/74 sitting, 106/68 standing with pulse 80-90 with
2`113`AC1234 `positional change.  He is afebrile.
2`113`AC1234 `Skin: Thinning, purpura over the dorsum of both hands, aggravated by the
2`113`AC1234 `Coumadin.
2`113`AC1234 `Lungs:  Decreased breath sounds without rhonchi or wheezes.
2`113`AC1234 `Cardiac: Normal S1 and S2 without S3, S4 or murmurs.  No carotid bruits.
2`113`AC1234 `Abdomen: Soft, nontender without organomegaly.
2`113`AC1234 `Nodes:  I could not appreciate definite adenopathy in the axillary,
2`113`AC1234 `inguinal or cervical regions.
2`113`AC1234 `Extremities:  Compression stocking in place on the left lower extremity,
2`113`AC1234 `no pitting edema in the right lower extremity.
2`113`AC1234 `Musculoskeletal:  Mild degenerative changes in his hands, knees, feet.
2`113`AC1234 `He has congenital elbow contractures.  He has cane which he uses for
2`113`AC1234 `assistance in his right hand with mild limitation of motion in the left
2`113`AC1234 `hip, no significant pain on motion.
2`113`AC1234 `Neurologic:  He is awake, oriented, with decreased left grip strength,
2`113`AC1234 `symmetrical reflexes.
2`113`AC1234 ` 
2`113`AC1234 `ASSESSMENT:
2`113`AC1234 `Some degree of orthostatic dizziness although he describes this in part
2`113`AC1234 `as his head feeling funny when he changes positions.
2`113`AC1234 ` 
2`113`AC1234 `He has had the extensive other difficulties as noted.
2`113`AC1234 ` 
2`113`AC1234 `PLAN:
2`113`AC1234 `1. Labs today.
2`113`AC1234 `2. EKG and chest x-ray today.
2`113`AC1234 `3. Trial of Meclizine 12.5 mg q6h prn.
2`113`AC1234 `4. Adequate fluid intake advised.  His wife will help keep track of this.
2`113`AC1234 `5. Continue use of compression stocking.  He does remove this overnight
2`113`AC1234 `and perhaps using just a TED stocking when he is in bed would be helpful
2`113`AC1234 `in reducing some of the early morning orthostatic dizziness.
2`113`AC1234 `6. He will be seeing Dr. Moore in December.
2`113`AC1234 `7. Return to me in 5-6 months or sooner if needed.  He and his wife both
2`113`AC1234 `had a repeat Pneumovax recently.

2`114`AC1234 `                                 ATT:  JOSEPH O. MOORE, M.D.
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `Procedure:  12/13/01             DICT: MARY S. MALICKI, R.N.
2`114`AC1234 `INTERVAL NOTE
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `INTERVAL HISTORY:  Dr. Johnson is an 84-year-old Caucasian
2`114`AC1234 `gentleman with a history of a large cell lymphoma status post
2`114`AC1234 `rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy completed 7/31/01.  He comes to clinic
2`114`AC1234 `today for results of recent CT scans.
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `At his last clinic visit, CT scan had revealed an area of a low
2`114`AC1234 `attenuation lesion in his pancreatic head as well as the appearance
2`114`AC1234 `of multiple renal lesions.  At that time, they were thought to be
2`114`AC1234 `cysts and we had him evaluated by Dr. Cary Robertson who agreed.
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `Since seen in his last clinic visit, he has followed with Dr.
2`114`AC1234 `Strittmatter for his memory disorder and underwent an MRI which
2`114`AC1234 `reveals a diffuse volume loss, but no evidence of any specific
2`114`AC1234 `pathologic disease.
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `He also had his great toe on his left foot removed per Dr. Moylan
2`114`AC1234 `for a fungal infection.  This has had problems healing and actually
2`114`AC1234 `Dr. Skip Burton had seen him and given him a prescription for
2`114`AC1234 `Keflex.  Also during that visit he was noted to have quite a bit of
2`114`AC1234 `swelling in his left leg when compared to his right, almost double
2`114`AC1234 `in size.  He has a history of a DVT and has been on Coumadin.  Dr.
2`114`AC1234 `Burton felt this was related to phlebitis syndrome and actually gave
2`114`AC1234 `him a compression stocking, and he has noticed a marked improvement
2`114`AC1234 `on this swelling.
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `His wife Jane's major concerns are of his toenail and wanting to
2`114`AC1234 `know if it is healing very well, and also of the 5 pounds he has
2`114`AC1234 `gained over the last couple months and whether this is fluid.
2`114`AC1234 `Previously she had been giving him some Maxzide, but has not been
2`114`AC1234 `weighing him lately, so he has not had any Maxzide in the recent
2`114`AC1234 `history.
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `He also has some complaints of dizziness when changing positions,
2`114`AC1234 `specifically when he first arises from his bed in the morning and
2`114`AC1234 `sometimes when lying in bed at night.  He saw Dr. Nancy Allen
2`114`AC1234 `earlier who gave him a prescription for a drug, but unfortunately he
2`114`AC1234 `did not bring this, so I do not know the exact drug.  I think it
2`114`AC1234 `could possibly be Antivert.
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `Otherwise, he has a good appetite.  He has no fevers, no chills.
2`114`AC1234 `Occasional headache, complaints of lack of strength in his left arm
2`114`AC1234 `and hand, but is currently working out with a trainer two times a
2`114`AC1234 `week and walking for about one mile every day.
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  1. Coumadin alternating 5 mg with 7.5 mg.
2`114`AC1234 `2. Celexa 20 mg q.d.  3. Multivitamin q.d.  4. Vitamin E q.d.

2`114`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  Dr. Moore reviewed Dr. Johnson's CT scans which do
2`114`AC1234 `not review any adenopathy.  We reviewed the areas in the kidney and
2`114`AC1234 `in the pancreatic areas that are thought to be cysts and are stable
2`114`AC1234 `in size.
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `Pleased how well Dr. Johnson is doing in regards to his lymphoma,
2`114`AC1234 `given him instructions on dressing his big toe.
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `Also recommended on weight gain, that he is to try to increase his
2`114`AC1234 `activity as much as he can, but have told Jane to weight him every
2`114`AC1234 `day and if he has an increase of 2 pounds than give him a Maxzide,
2`114`AC1234 `but only do this when weighing him, and then see if he has response.
2`114`AC1234 `Possibly it just could be his caloric intake, because he does not
2`114`AC1234 `appear fluid overloaded today.
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `He has been off his Coumadin for about five days due to dental work
2`114`AC1234 `and just restarted two days ago.  Due to this, we will have his
2`114`AC1234 `protime checked after the Christmas holidays to reevaluate and
2`114`AC1234 `possibly adjust his dose.
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `He will return to clinic in three months when we will repeat his
2`114`AC1234 `chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT.
2`114`AC1234 ` 
2`114`AC1234 `I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and
2`114`AC1234 `concur with the above findings.

2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `INTERVAL HISTORY:  Dr. Johnson is an 84-year-old Caucasian
2`115`AC1234 `gentleman with a history of a large cell lymphoma status post
2`115`AC1234 `rituxan and CNOP chemotherapy completed 7/31/01.  He comes to clinic
2`115`AC1234 `today for results of recent CT scans.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `At his last clinic visit, CT scan had revealed an area of a low
2`115`AC1234 `attenuation lesion in his pancreatic head as well as the appearance
2`115`AC1234 `of multiple renal lesions.  At that time, they were thought to be
2`115`AC1234 `cysts and we had him evaluated by Dr. Cary Robertson who agreed.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `Since seen in his last clinic visit, he has followed with Dr.
2`115`AC1234 `Strittmatter for his memory disorder and underwent an MRI which
2`115`AC1234 `reveals a diffuse volume loss, but no evidence of any specific
2`115`AC1234 `pathologic disease.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `He also had his great toe on his left foot removed per Dr. Moylan
2`115`AC1234 `for a fungal infection.  This has had problems healing and actually
2`115`AC1234 `Dr. Skip Burton had seen him and given him a prescription for
2`115`AC1234 `Keflex.  Also during that visit he was noted to have quite a bit of
2`115`AC1234 `swelling in his left leg when compared to his right, almost double
2`115`AC1234 `in size.  He has a history of a DVT and has been on Coumadin.  Dr.
2`115`AC1234 `Burton felt this was related to phlebitis syndrome and actually gave
2`115`AC1234 `him a compression stocking, and he has noticed a marked improvement
2`115`AC1234 `on this swelling.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `His wife Jane's major concerns are of his toenail and wanting to
2`115`AC1234 `know if it is healing very well, and also of the 5 pounds he has
2`115`AC1234 `gained over the last couple months and whether this is fluid.
2`115`AC1234 `Previously she had been giving him some Maxzide, but has not been
2`115`AC1234 `weighing him lately, so he has not had any Maxzide in the recent
2`115`AC1234 `history.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `He also has some complaints of dizziness when changing positions,
2`115`AC1234 `specifically when he first arises from his bed in the morning and
2`115`AC1234 `sometimes when lying in bed at night.  He saw Dr. Nancy Allen
2`115`AC1234 `earlier who gave him a prescription for a drug, but unfortunately he
2`115`AC1234 `did not bring this, so I do not know the exact drug.  I think it
2`115`AC1234 `could possibly be Antivert.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `Otherwise, he has a good appetite.  He has no fevers, no chills.
2`115`AC1234 `Occasional headache, complaints of lack of strength in his left arm
2`115`AC1234 `and hand, but is currently working out with a trainer two times a
2`115`AC1234 `week and walking for about one mile every day.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  1. Coumadin alternating 5 mg with 7.5 mg.

2`115`AC1234 `  Clinical History: Patient with lymphoma.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  Technique: Multiple contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung
2`115`AC1234 `apices through the pubic symphysis after the uneventful administration of
2`115`AC1234 `oral
2`115`AC1234 `and IV contrast. The field-of-view = 38 cm.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  Findings: Two small indeterminate pulmonary nodules are seen in the
2`115`AC1234 `right
2`115`AC1234 `lower lobe and right middle lobe which are stable from the prior
2`115`AC1234 `examination.
2`115`AC1234 `On the prior exam there was a nodular opacity seen in the left upper lobe
2`115`AC1234 `which is not appreciated today.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  There is no significant mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
2`115`AC1234 `lymphadenopathy.
2`115`AC1234 `There is minimal bibasilar dependent atelectasis. There are no pleural
2`115`AC1234 `effusions.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  There are multiple small low-attenuation lesion seen in the liver which
2`115`AC1234 `are
2`115`AC1234 `unchanged from the prior examination. The small low-attenuation lesions
2`115`AC1234 `seen
2`115`AC1234 `in the spleen are smaller and less well-defined than on the prior
2`115`AC1234 `examination.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  There is a cystic lesion with calcification seen adjacent to the
2`115`AC1234 `pancreatic
2`115`AC1234 `body. In addition there is a second cystic lesion  in the area of the
2`115`AC1234 `pancreatic head. These are unchanged from the prior examination.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  There are are simple cysts seen in the right kidney. There is a simple
2`115`AC1234 `cyst
2`115`AC1234 `seen in the left kidney in addition, there are 2 hyperdense indeterminant
2`115`AC1234 `low-attenuation lesion seen in the left kidney which are stable from the
2`115`AC1234 `prior
2`115`AC1234 `examination. One of these lesions contains calcification.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  There is no significant pathologic lymphadenopathy.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  The small bowel and colon are unremarkable.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  There are small calcified foci seen in the posterior bladder which most
2`115`AC1234 `likely represent bladder calcifications.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  Impression:
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  1. Interval improvement in splenic lesions.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  2. No residual pathologic lymphadenopathy.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  3. Stable small low-attenuation lesions in the liver.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  4. Cystic lesions seen in the area of the pancreatic body and head
2`115`AC1234 `which
2`115`AC1234 `are stable from the prior examination. These most likely represent cystic
2`115`AC1234 `pancreatic neoplasms.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  5. Stable simple renal cysts.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `  6.Stable indeterminate renal lesions stable which may represent a renal
2`115`AC1234 `neoplasm vs.complex cysts. Recommend unenhanced CT as part of next
2`115`AC1234 `follow-up
2`115`AC1234 `study for further evaluation.
2`115`AC1234 `

2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  Dr. Moore reviewed Dr. Johnson's CT scans which do
2`115`AC1234 `not review any adenopathy.  We reviewed the areas in the kidney and
2`115`AC1234 `in the pancreatic areas that are thought to be cysts and are stable
2`115`AC1234 `in size.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `Pleased how well Dr. Johnson is doing in regards to his lymphoma,
2`115`AC1234 `given him instructions on dressing his big toe.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `Also recommended on weight gain, that he is to try to increase his
2`115`AC1234 `activity as much as he can, but have told Jane to weight him every
2`115`AC1234 `day and if he has an increase of 2 pounds than give him a Maxzide,
2`115`AC1234 `but only do this when weighing him, and then see if he has response.
2`115`AC1234 `Possibly it just could be his caloric intake, because he does not
2`115`AC1234 `appear fluid overloaded today.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `He has been off his Coumadin for about five days due to dental work
2`115`AC1234 `and just restarted two days ago.  Due to this, we will have his
2`115`AC1234 `protime checked after the Christmas holidays to reevaluate and
2`115`AC1234 `possibly adjust his dose.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `He will return to clinic in three months when we will repeat his
2`115`AC1234 `chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT.
2`115`AC1234 ` 
2`115`AC1234 `I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and
2`115`AC1234 `concur with the above findings.

2`119`AC1234 `HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
2`119`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson is an 84 year old retired Duke Surgeon.  His medical
2`119`AC1234 `history is outlined in the problem list above and include cerebrovascular
2`119`AC1234 `small vessel disease with short term memory loss, and most recently a
2`119`AC1234 `diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and a DVT of the left lower extremity
2`119`AC1234 `on 8/26/01.  He has no history of heart disease.  He denies symptoms of
2`119`AC1234 `chest pain, shortness of breath or other cardiac related symptoms.
2`119`AC1234 ` 
2`119`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson was last seen in our clinic on 3/15/01 at which time his
2`119`AC1234 `cardiovascular exam was normal.  His exam at that visit did reveal
2`119`AC1234 `cervical lymphadenopathy as well as a golf ball size left movable axilla
2`119`AC1234 `node.  He was referred to Dr. Joe Moore in Oncology for further
2`119`AC1234 `evaluation.  He subsequently has been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's
2`119`AC1234 `lymphoma and has undergone chemotherapy with the last treatment being
2`119`AC1234 `completed this past 7/01.  Other significant medical issues in the interim
2`119`AC1234 `include a left lower extremity DVT in 8/01, treated with Coumadin.
2`119`AC1234 ` 
2`119`AC1234 `Today, Dr. Johnson states he feels well, has a good appetite and is
2`119`AC1234 `sleeping well.  He continues to have now bilateral lower extremity edema.
2`119`AC1234 `He has been wearing knee high bilateral Jobst compression stockings which
2`119`AC1234 `have helped somewhat.  His wife is accompanying him today in clinic and
2`119`AC1234 `expresses concern about the possibility of a second DVT since his right
2`119`AC1234 `leg now has edema.  He denies symptoms of calf pain and tenderness.
2`119`AC1234 ` 
2`119`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson has started to exercise at a local health club where he is
2`119`AC1234 `currently working with a personal trainer.
2`119`AC1234 `

2`119`AC1234 `ASSESSMENT
2`119`AC1234 `1)  Cardiac.  Dr. Johnson has a normal cardiovascular exam today and
2`119`AC1234 `is currently having no cardiac symptoms.
2`119`AC1234 `2)  Bilateral lower extremity edema.  Dr. Johnson had a left lower
2`119`AC1234 `extremity DVT treated with  Coumadin this past August.  He continues to
2`119`AC1234 `complain of increasing edema in his lower extremities and is worried about
2`119`AC1234 `the possibility of a second DVT.  He is no longer taking anti-coagulants
2`119`AC1234 `or daily Aspirin.
2`119`AC1234 ` 
2`119`AC1234 `PLAN
2`119`AC1234 `1)  Schedule bilateral venous doppler to rule out DVT.
2`119`AC1234 `2)  Re-start Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
2`119`AC1234 `3)  FOBT.  Stool cards x 3 given to patient for colon cancer screening.
2`119`AC1234 `4)  Return to clinic in 1 year for annual evaluation.  Pending doppler
2`119`AC1234 `results as ordered above, may require additional follow-up.

2`120`AC1234 `INTERVAL NOTE
2`120`AC1234 ` 
2`120`AC1234 `INTERVAL HISTORY:  Dr. Johnson is an 84-year-old Caucasian
2`120`AC1234 `gentleman with a history of a diffuse, large, B-cell lymphoma,
2`120`AC1234 `status post chemotherapy, completed 7/31/01.  He comes to clinic
2`120`AC1234 `today for results of recent CT scans.
2`120`AC1234 ` 
2`120`AC1234 `Since his last clinic visit, Dr. Johnson has actually been doing
2`120`AC1234 `very well.  He is working out with a trainer three times a week and
2`120`AC1234 `is starting to improve with his strength.
2`120`AC1234 ` 
2`120`AC1234 `He has a history of a DVT and had been on Coumadin but stopped his
2`120`AC1234 `Coumadin after six months.  His swelling in his legs was
2`120`AC1234 `significantly better.  He went to see Dr. Cobb, his
2`120`AC1234 `cardiologist/primary care physician, last week and was having some
2`120`AC1234 `swelling of the other leg and so went to Dr. Skip Burton and
2`120`AC1234 `received compression stockings for both legs, which he has been
2`120`AC1234 `wearing.  They tell me that Dr. Cobb has ordered an ultrasound of
2`120`AC1234 `both legs that is scheduled for next week.
2`120`AC1234 ` 
2`120`AC1234 `He has had a good appetite, has actually been gaining weight.
2`120`AC1234 ` 
2`120`AC1234 `His wife is also wondering about his colonoscopy, as his last one
2`120`AC1234 `was four years ago.  He received this through Dr. Scott Brazer and
2`120`AC1234 `they tried to arrange this through him, but unfortunately Dr. Brazer
2`120`AC1234 `is leaving the Duke community.

2`120`AC1234 `   lesions, all stable.  New tiny lesion in right lung.
2`120`AC1234 ` 
2`120`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  Dr. Moore personally reviewed his CT scans and those
2`120`AC1234 `appear to do very well.  At this time, he does not require any
2`120`AC1234 `intervention.  The possibility of a new gastroenterologist we have
2`120`AC1234 `recommended would be Dr. John Baillie.
2`120`AC1234 ` 
2`120`AC1234 `I have personally reviewed the history, examined the patient, and

2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  Comparison: CT chest abdomen pelvis, 12/12/01.
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  Oral contrast enhanced chest abdomen pelvis performed. IV contrast was
2`121`AC1234 `not
2`121`AC1234 `administered as patient's creatinine was 2.1. This was discussed with Dr.
2`121`AC1234 `Hurwitz at time of study. DFOV 38 cm.
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  Findings:
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  Chest: On the current scan a tiny indeterminate nodule is seen
2`121`AC1234 `peripherally
2`121`AC1234 `in the right upper lobe (image 13). Minimal bibasilar atelectasis noted.
2`121`AC1234 `One
2`121`AC1234 `of the indeterminate lesion, adjacent to major fissure appears less
2`121`AC1234 `conspicuous. The other lesion is not visualized on current exam.
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  Abdomen pelvis: Lack of IV contrast limits evaluation of visceral
2`121`AC1234 `organs.
2`121`AC1234 `Allowing for this the multiple low attenuation lesion seen within the
2`121`AC1234 `liver
2`121`AC1234 `are unchanged. The smaller lesions are not identified on current scan,
2`121`AC1234 `likely
2`121`AC1234 `due to lack of IV contrast.
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  Again noted are multiple low attenuation lesion within both kidneys.
2`121`AC1234 `These
2`121`AC1234 `are in keeping with renal cysts and remain unchanged. In addition a 1cm
2`121`AC1234 `hyperdense lesion (HU 34) with peripheral calcification is seen in the
2`121`AC1234 `anterior mid left kidney. Another hyperdense lesion (HU35), is seen in
2`121`AC1234 `the
2`121`AC1234 `posterior mid right kidney. These remain stable.
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  Stable appearance of 2cm low attenuation lesion within the pancreatic
2`121`AC1234 `head.
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  Again noted is diffuse calcification of the abdominal aorta. No
2`121`AC1234 `significant
2`121`AC1234 `retroperitoneum adenopathy is noted. Visualized bowel loops are grossly
2`121`AC1234 `unremarkable. Stable appearance of small calcific focus in the posterior
2`121`AC1234 `bladder.
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  Impression:
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  1. Multiple low-attenuation liver lesions overall remain stable.
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  2. One of the indeterminate pulmonary lesions not visualized. The other
2`121`AC1234 `appears less conspicuous. A new tiny lesion is seen in the right lung.
2`121`AC1234 `The
2`121`AC1234 `variable appearance may be due to difference in slice selection.
2`121`AC1234 `Attention on
2`121`AC1234 `follow-up.
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  3. Lack of IV contrast limits the characterization of splenic lesion
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  4. Stable appearance of cystic lesion of the pancreas.
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  5. Stable renal cystic lesions bilaterally, as discussed above. Further
2`121`AC1234 `characterization difficult due to lack of IV contrast.
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  6. No significant abdominal or pelvic  lymphadenopathy.
2`121`AC1234 ` 
2`121`AC1234 `  I have reviewed the film and concur with the above findings.

2`121`AC1234 `DISPOSITION:  Dr. Moore personally reviewed his CT scans and those
2`121`AC1234 `appear to do very well.  At this time, he does not require any
2`121`AC1234 `intervention.  The possibility of a new gastroenterologist we have
2`121`AC1234 `recommended would be Dr. John Baillie.

2`122`AC1234 `Division of Orthopaedics
2`122`AC1234 ` 
2`122`AC1234 ` 
2`122`AC1234 `Reason for evaluation: Right  hand
2`122`AC1234 ` 
2`122`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson is currently 84 years of age, right hand dominant.  He has
2`122`AC1234 `recovered from a bout of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and seems to have been
2`122`AC1234 `cured from that.  He currently takes only vitamins as his medication.  He
2`122`AC1234 `has not had any particular problem with his left hand. He does have a
2`122`AC1234 `subtle cord proximal to the long finger on the left side but he is able to
2`122`AC1234 `extend his digits well.  Index MCP lacks about 5 degrees and PIP 5. Long
2`122`AC1234 `MCP extends to neutral. PIP lacks 7. Ring MCP extends to neutral and PIP
2`122`AC1234 `lacks about 7.  Small MCP hyperextends slightly and PIP lacks 15.  He is
2`122`AC1234 `able to flex fingertips to the distal palmar crease.  He has no numbness,
2`122`AC1234 `tingling or any other symptoms on the left.  Radial and ulnar arteries
2`122`AC1234 `fill to Allen testing.  He does have a subtle cord proximal to the small
2`122`AC1234 `finger also.
2`122`AC1234 ` 
2`122`AC1234 `He says that he uses mostly his left hand despite the fact that he is
2`122`AC1234 `right-handed.  He is open to open doors.  He is thinking about playing
2`122`AC1234 `golf rather than tennis.
2`122`AC1234 ` 
2`122`AC1234 `On examination,  he still has the hyperpigmentation on the dorsal aspect
2`122`AC1234 `of his hand.  He extends his digits such that the index MCP lacks 15 and
2`122`AC1234 `PIP lacks 10. Long MCP lacks 10 and PIP lacks 12.  Ring MCP lacks 15 and
2`122`AC1234 `PIP lacks 40.  Small MCP lacks 5 and PIP lacks 80 and DIP lacks 25.  When
2`122`AC1234 `her flexes, fingertips flex to the palm but not quite distal palmar
2`122`AC1234 `crease.  Small MCP flexes 85 and PIP flexes 110.  DIP flexes 55. Ring MCP
2`122`AC1234 `flexes 85, PIP 110. DIP 60. Long MCP flexes 85 and PIP 110.  Index MCP
2`122`AC1234 `flexes 65 and PIP 105.  His wrist extends 40 and flexes 20.  Radial and
2`122`AC1234 `ulnar arteries fill to Allen testing.  Two point discrimination is 5 mms.
2`122`AC1234 `at radial and ulnar aspects of all digits. Radial digital artery to his
2`122`AC1234 `little finger fills briskly and ulnar digital more slowly.
2`122`AC1234 ` 
2`122`AC1234 `We talked about the options of treatment.  One is to try to soft tissue
2`122`AC1234 `release the digit.  This would theoretically be possible although
2`122`AC1234 `currently, much of his contracture is secondary to scar tissue and not
2`122`AC1234 `isolated palmar fibromatosis and there is a reasonably good chance that
2`122`AC1234 `the result would not be ideal.  The next option would be extending the
2`122`AC1234 `digit with the PIP in about 55 degrees of flexion and arthrodesing it.
2`122`AC1234 `This would make it easier for him to get gloves on but would make it more
2`122`AC1234 `difficult to grip objects.  The next possibility would be to leave the
2`122`AC1234 `digit until he finds that it is definitely not accessible to function and
2`122`AC1234 `then amputate the distal and middle phalanges through the PIP joint.  That
2`122`AC1234 `would be the quickest and the easiest for him and he seemed to be inclined
2`122`AC1234 `toward that option.
2`122`AC1234 ` 
2`122`AC1234 `Currently no decision is being made. He is going to Europe and then to
2`122`AC1234 `the mountains and I will plan to see him in September when he returns. He
2`122`AC1234 `will call to arrange the appointment.

2`123`AC1234 `HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
2`123`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson, his wife and their daughter return to clinic today for a
2`123`AC1234 `follow-up visit.  He was last seen by me on November 12, 2001.  the
2`123`AC1234 `complete history, physical examination and past medical history is
2`123`AC1234 `summarized in that note.  Since the last clinic visit Dr. Johnson and
2`123`AC1234 `his wife took a trip to London and Dusseldorf.  he, however, could not
2`123`AC1234 `remember any of the details of the trip.  He has had persisting problems
2`123`AC1234 `with memory as summarized previously.  In addition to these baseline
2`123`AC1234 `memory difficulties Dr. Johnson had 2 episodes.  One of these episodes
2`123`AC1234 `consisted of him being suddenly unresponsive to verbal questioning and the
2`123`AC1234 `speaking "gibberish" for approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  Immediately prior
2`123`AC1234 `to this he was at his previous functional level.  He subsequently had
2`123`AC1234 `resolution of this spell and returned to baseline.  In addition he had an
2`123`AC1234 `episode where he in the middle of the night was asking about his
2`123`AC1234 `relationship to one of his daughters.  This confusional episode only
2`123`AC1234 `lasted briefly.
2`123`AC1234 ` 
2`123`AC1234 `He denies any new problems.  He specifically denies any difficulties with
2`123`AC1234 `sleep.  His appetite is described as good.  He is having no bowel or
2`123`AC1234 `bladder symptoms.  The previous symptoms of dizziness have resolved.
2`123`AC1234 ` 
2`123`AC1234 `On MMSE today he scored 24.
2`123`AC1234 ` 
2`123`AC1234 `Dr. Johnson has significant memory dysfunction as summarized
2`123`AC1234 `previously.  Today I am initiating Aricept 5 mg a day after discussing the
2`123`AC1234 `pros and cons with him and the family.  I am also ordering an EEG to
2`123`AC1234 `determine whether or not there is any evidence of epileptiform activity.
2`123`AC1234 ` 
2`123`AC1234 `The patient will return to clinic to see me in approximately one month.

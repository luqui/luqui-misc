NAME

	Parse::Earley - Parse I<any> context-free grammar
	Version 0.16

DESCRIPTION

	Parse::Earley is an implementation of Earley's algorithm for
	parsing context-free grammars.  It has the ability to accept
	an input for any context-free grammar you give it.  It's not
	a fast algorithm, just an effective one.  See the documentation
	for more details.

PREREQUISITES

	Parse::Earley requires Text::Balanced, which is included with 5.8.0.
	Otherwise, it comes with Parse::RecDescent or on its own.

INSTALLATION

	Pure Perl: Put .pm's proper places.

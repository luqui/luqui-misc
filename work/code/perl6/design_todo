Pending proposals:

* Junctions
* Theories / data constructors

Things I am still dissatisfied with and will address.

* Classes are just undefs
* ./method should exist
* No tuple type

Things I am dissatisfied with but am willing to live with:

* Hyper list semantics

Things that need to be more thoroughly defined:

* Parametric types / type variables

purpose:     To inform the audience

summary:     To introduce the audience to the game of limit Texas 
             Hold'em poker, and to inform them about the qualities of 
             a good poker player on a mechanical level.

main points: The game of limit Texas Hold'em consists of two cards
             dealt face down to each player (the "pocket"), and five
             cards face up (the "board") that everyone uses to make the
             best five-card hand.
             
             A good limit player understands all the odds, and throws
             away his hand when the odds aren't in his favor (this is
             quite different from no limit).

             A good limit player knows when to raise, to either grow the
             pot or thin the competition.

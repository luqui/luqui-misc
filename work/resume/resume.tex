\maketitle

I have nine years of programming experience with focus on software
architecture and abstraction, scripting languages\footnote{Embedding,
using, and designing.}, automated testing and quality assurance, and
artificial intelligence.  I am very interested in automated testing
techniques for games, ensuring code quality, maintainability, and
documentation.  I am also interested in core gameplay dynamics (a game
that is all polish and no core is nothing) and founding designs in
mathematical theory for emergent dynamics.

\section*{Accomplishments}

\begin{itemize}
\item Worked with Larry Wall as a member of the Perl Cabal (Perl 6
Design Team) since 2004.
\item Implemented the Perl Grammar Engine in Perl 6, an essential piece
of the bootstrapping process, using a very modular design (``virtual
classes''). \\
\verb|http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/ext/Parse-Rule/|
\item Authored 15 Perl 5 modules including a large predicate logic
engine, several object-oriented design tools, an attribute grammar
engine (complex data structure processing tool), among other things, all
with extensive documentation and test suites.

\item Authored and co-authored many small, cross-platform games, some of
which are at \verb|http://soylentsoft.net/|.  My largest contributions
to the projects there were: the fluid dynamics engine for Ichor, the
fast automated solver for Minesweeper Infinity (to ensure that the user
never gets an unsolvable board), and the transactional logic engine for
Telegnosis (well, all of Telegnosis, actually).
\item Presented as an ``emerging topics'' speaker at the O'Reilly Open
Source Convention 2004 a talk entitled ``A Language for Games''.  \\

\section*{Career History/Education}

\begin{itemize}
\item BA/MA student of mathematics at the University of Colorado since
2002, presently on a year-long hiatus\footnote{And I am willing to go
back to school one or two classes at a time if I find a job I like}
until spring 2008.  GPA: 3.32; Major (mathematics) GPA: 3.80.  \item
Worked on the large, open source Perl 6 project continuously since
2001.
\item Teaching Assistant in Physics 2 at CU in 2006 under Dr. Steven
Pollock.
\item Teaching Assistant in Introductory Computer Science at CU in 2006
under Dr. Susanne Sherba.
\item Worked on MVT (mathematics visualization toolkit) for the summer
of 2005. \verb|http://amath.colorado.edu/java/index.php|
\item Worked on a medical natural language processing project in 2004 with
Dr. Robert Bruegel and Dr. Ngo Thanh Nhan (not associated with the
University of Colorado).
\item Teaching Assistant in Calculus 2 at CU in 2004 under Dr. Mark
Ablowitz.
\item Worked on a medical expert system in 2003 with Dr. Robert Bruegel.
\item Teaching Assistant in Physics 2 at CU in 2003 under Dr. Mike
Dubson.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Qualifications}

\begin{itemize}
\item 7 years experience with C and C++; I know all weird the nooks and
crannys of C++, and can use them in order to achieve the best design.
\item Plenty of experience with physics programming (wrote a physics
engine for a game early on, and have made several games using the Open
Dynamics Engine physics library).
\item Experience with \textit{many} other languages, including Perl,
Ruby, Lua, Python, Java, Haskell, Lisp, Prolog, Curry, Scala, ....  I
can learn new languages very quickly.  Experience with embedding Perl,
Ruby, and Lua into C++ projects. 
\item Lots of experience with Subversion and some with CVS.
\item Experience with JUnit, Test::More, and building my own unit
testing frameworks with Test::Builder.
\item Fundamental desire for clean, abstract software design.  Lots of
experience refactoring code into such designs.
\item Desire and experience in building extremely simple but powerful
systems, usually strongly founded in mathematical theory.
\end{itemize}
